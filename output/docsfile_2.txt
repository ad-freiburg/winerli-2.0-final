7	It is located in the department of Yvelines, in the region of Île-de-France, about  southwest of the centre of Paris.
8	The palace is now a Monument historique and UNESCO World Heritage site, notable especially for the ceremonial Hall of Mirrors, the jewel-like Royal Opera, and the royal apartments; for the more intimate royal residences, the Grand Trianon and Petit Trianon located within the park; the small rustic Hameau (Hamlet) created for Marie Antoinette; and the vast Gardens of Versailles with fountains, canals, and geometric flower beds and groves, laid out by André le Nôtre.
9	The Palace was stripped of all its furnishings after the French Revolution, but many pieces have been returned and many of the palace rooms have been restored.
10	In 2017 the Palace of Versailles received 7,700,000 visitors, making it the second-most visited monument in the Île-de-France region, just behind the Louvre and ahead of the Eiffel Tower.

15	The terrace was replaced by the Hall of Mirrors The site of the Palace was first occupied by a small village and church, surrounded by forests filled with abundant game.
16	It was owned by the Gondi family and the priory of Saint Julian.
17	King Henry IV went hunting there in 1589, and returned in 1604 and 1609, staying in the village inn.
18	His son, the future Louis XIII, came on his own hunting trip there in 1607.
19	After he became King in 1610, Louis XIII returned to the village, bought some land, and in 1623-24 built a modest two-story hunting lodge the site of the current marble courtyard.
20	He was staying there in November 1630 during the event known as the Day of the Dupes, when the enemies of the King's chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu, aided by the King's mother, Marie de' Medici, tried to take over the government.
21	The King defeated the plot and sent his mother into exile.
22	After this event, Louis XIII decided to make his hunting lodge at Versailles into a château.
23	The King purchased the surrounding territory from the Gondi family, and in 1631–1634 had the architect Philibert Le Roy replace the hunting lodge with a château of brick and stone with classical pilasters in the doric style and high slate-covered roofs, surrounding the courtyard of the original hunting lodge.
24	The gardens and park were also enlarged, laid out by Jacques Boyceau and his nephew, Jacques de Menours (1591–1637), and reached essentially the size they have today.
25	The palace of Louis XIVLouis XIV first visited the château on a hunting trip in 1651 at the age of twelve, but returned only occasionally until his marriage to Maria Theresa of Spain in 1660 and the death of Cardinal Mazarin in 1661, after which he suddenly acquired a passion for the site.
26	He decided to rebuild, embellish and enlarge the château and to transform it into a setting for both rest and for elaborate entertainments on a grand scale.
27	The first phase of the expansion (c. 1661–1678) was designed and supervised by the architect Louis Le Vau.
28	Initially he added two wings to the forecourt, one for servants quarters and kitchens, the other for stables.
29	In 1668 he added three new wings built of stone, known as the envelope, to the north, south and west (the garden side) of the original château.
30	These buildings had nearly-flat roofs covered with lead.
31	The king also commissioned the landscape designer André Le Nôtre to create the most magnificent gardens in Europe, embellished with fountains, statues, basins, canals, geometric flower beds and groves of trees.
32	He also added two grottos in the Italian style and an immense orangerie to house fruit trees, as well as a zoo with a central pavilion for exotic animals.
33	After Le Vau's death in 1670, the work was taken over and completed by his assistant François d'Orbay.
34	The main floor (above the ground floor) of the new palace contained two symmetrical sets of apartments, one for the king and the other for the queen, looking over the gardens.
35	The two apartments were separated by a marble terrace, overlooking the garden, with a fountain in the center.
36	Each set of apartments was connected to the ground floor with a ceremonial stairway, and each had seven rooms, aligned in a row; a vestibule, a room for the guards, an antechamber, chamber, a large cabinet or office; a smaller bedroom, and a smaller cabinet.
37	On the ground floor under the King's apartment was another apartment, the same size, designed for his private life, and decorated on the theme of Apollo, the Sun god, his personal emblem.
38	Under the Queen's apartment was the apartment of the Grand Dauphin, the heir to the throne.
39	The interior decoration was assigned to Charles Le Brun.
40	Le Brun supervised the work of a large group of sculptors and painters, called the Petite Academie, who crafted and painted the ornate walls and ceilings.
41	Le Brun also supervised the design and installation of countless statues in the gardens.
42	The grand stairway to the King's apartment was soon redecorated almost as soon as it was completed with plaques of colored marble and trophies of arms, tapestries, and balconies, so the members of the court could observe the processions of the King.
43	In 1670, Le Vau added a new pavilion northwest of the chateau, called the Trianon, for the King's relaxation in the hot summers.
44	It was surrounded by flowerbeds and decorated entirely with blue and white porcelain, in imitation of the Chinese style.
45	Enlargement of the Palace (1678-1715)
46	The King increasingly spent his days in Versailles, and the government, court, and courtiers, numbering six to seven thousand persons, crowded into the buildings.
47	The King ordered a further enlargement, which he entrusted to the young architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart.
48	Hadouin-Mansart added two large new wings on either side of the original Cour Royale (Royal Courtyard).
49	He also replaced Le Vau's large terrace, facing the garden on the west, with what became the most famous room of the palace, the Hall of Mirrors.
50	Mansart also built the Petites Écuries and Grandes Écuries (stables) across the Place d'Armes, on the eastern side of the château.
51	The King wished a quiet place to relax away from the ceremony of the Court.
52	In 1687 Hardouin-Mansart began the Grand Trianon, or Trianon de Marbre (Marble Trianon), replacing Le Vau's 1668 Trianon de Porcelaine in the northern section of the park.
53	In 1682 Louis XIV was able to proclaim Versailles his principal residence and the seat of the government and was able to give rooms in the palace to almost all of his courtiers.
54	After the death of Maria Theresa of Spain in 1683, Louis XIV undertook the enlargement and remodeling of the royal apartments in the original part of the palace, within the former hunting lodge built by his father.
55	He instructed Mansart to begin the construction of the Royal Chapel of Versailles, which towered over the rest of the palace.
56	Hardouin-Mansart died in 1708 and so the chapel was completed by his assistant Robert de Cotte in 1710.
57	The Palace of Louis XVA masked ball in the Hall of Mirrors (1745) by Nicolas Cochin Louis XIV died in 1715, and the young new King, Louis XV, just five years old, and his government were moved temporarily from Versailles to Paris under the regency of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans.
58	In 1722, when the King came of age, he moved his residence and the government back to Versailles, where it remained until the French Revolution in 1789.
59	Louis XV remained faithful to the original plan of his great-grandfather, and made few changes to the exteriors of Versailles.
60	His main contributions were the construction of the Salon of Hercules, which connected the main building of the Palace with the north wing and the chapel (1724–36); and the royal opera theater, designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel, and built between 1769 and 1770.
61	The new theater was completed in time for the celebration of the wedding of the Dauphin, the future Louis XVI, and Archduchess Marie Antoinette of Austria.
62	He also made numerous additions and changes to the royal apartments, where he, the Queen, his daughters, and his heir lived.
63	In 1738, Louis XV remodeled the king's petit appartement on the north side of the Cour de Marbre, originally the entrance court of the old château.
64	He discreetly provided accommodations in another part of the palace for his famous mistresses, Madame de Pompadour and later Madame du Barry.
65	The extension of the King's petit appartement necessitated the demolition of the Ambassador's Staircase, one of the most admired features of Louis XIV's palace, which left the Palace without a grand staircase entrance.
66	The following year Louis XV ordered the demolition of the north wing facing onto the Cour Royale, which had fallen into serious disrepair.
67	He commissioned Gabriel to rebuild it in a more neoclassical style.
68	The new wing was completed in 1780.
69	Louis XVI, and the Palace during the RevolutionLouis XVI and Marie Antoinette, with Lafayette, face the angry crowd from their balcony at Versailles, October 6, 1789 Louis XVI was constrained by the worsening financial situation of the kingdom from making major changes to the palace, so that he primarily focused on improvements to the royal apartments.
70	Louis XVI gave Marie Antoinette the Petit Trianon in 1774.
71	The Queen made extensive changes to the interior, and added a theater, the Théâtre de la Reine.
72	She also totally transformed the arboretum planted during the reign of Louis XV into what became known as the Hameau de la Reine.
73	This was a picturesque collection of buildings modeled after a rural French hamlet, where the Queen and her courtiers could play at being peasants.
74	The Queen was at the Petit Trianon in 1789 when she first learned of the beginning of the French Revolution in July 1789.
75	In 1783, the Palace was the site of the signing of three treaties of the Peace of Paris (1783), in which the United Kingdom recognized the independence of the United States.
76	The King and Queen learned of the storming of the Bastille in Paris on July 14, 1789.
77	while they were at the Palace, and remained isolated there as the Revolution in Paris spread.
78	The growing anger in Paris led to the Women's March on Versailles on 5 October 1789.
79	A crowd of several thousand men and women, protesting the high price and scarcity of bread, marched from the markets of Paris to Versailles.
80	They took weapons from the city armory, besieged the Palace, and compelled the King and Royal family and the members of the National Assembly to return with them to Paris the following day.
81	As soon as the royal family departed, the Palace was closed, awaiting their return.
82	In 1792, the Convention, the new revolutionary government, ordered the transfer of all the paintings and sculptures from the Palace to the Louvre.
83	In 1793, the Convention declared the abolition of the monarchy, and ordered all of the royal property in the Palace to be sold at auction.
84	The auction took place between 25 August 1793 and 11 August 1794.
85	The furnishings and art of the Palace, including the furniture, mirrors, baths and kitchen equipment, were sold in seventeen thousand lots.
86	All fleurs-de-lys and royal emblems on the buildings were chambered or chiseled off.
87	The empty buildings were turned into a storehouse for furnishings, art and libraries confiscated from the nobility.
88	The empty grand apartments were opened for tours beginning in 1793, and a small museum of French paintings and art school was opened in some of the empty rooms.

90	August 1855  Proclamation of the German Empire, 18 January 1871, 1877 by Anton von Werner When Napoleon Bonaparte became Emperor of the French in 1804, he considered making Versailles his residence, but abandoned the idea because of the cost of the renovation.
91	Prior to his marriage with Marie-Louise in 1810, he had the Grand Trianon restored and refurnished as a springtime residence for himself and his family, in the style of furnishing that it is seen today.
92	In 1815, with the final downfall of Napoleon, Louis XVIII, the younger brother of Louis XVI, became King, and considered returning the royal residence to Versailles, where he had been born.
93	He ordered the restoration of the royal apartments, but the task and cost was too great.
94	Neither he nor his successor Charles X lived at Versailles.
95	The French Revolution of 1830 brought a new monarch, Louis-Philippe to power, and a new ambition for Versailles.
96	He did not reside at Versailles, but began the creation of the Museum of the History of France, dedicated to \"all the glories of France\", located in the south wing of the Palace, which had been used to house some members of the royal family.
97	The museum was begun in 1833 and inaugurated on 30 June 1837.
98	Its most famous room is the Galerie des Batailles (Hall of Battles), which lies on most of the length of the second floor.
99	Louis Philippe had the far end of the south wing of the Cour Royale demolished and rebuilt to match the Gabriel wing of 1780 opposite, which gave greater uniformity of appearance to the front entrance.
100	The museum project largely came to a halt when Louis Philippe was overthrown in 1848, though the paintings of French heroes and great battles still remain in the south wing.
101	Emperor Napoleon III used the Palace on occasion as a stage for grand ceremonies.
102	One of the most lavish was the banquet that he hosted for Queen Victoria in the Royal Opera of Versailles on August 25, 1855.
103	During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, the Palace was occupied by the general staff of the victorious German Army.
104	Parts of the chateau, including the Gallery of Mirrors, were turned into a military hospital.
105	The creation of the German Empire, combining Prussia and the surrounding German states under William I, was formally proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors on January 18, 1871.
106	The Germans remained in the Palace until the signing of the armistice in March 1871.
107	In that month, the government of the new Third French Republic, which had departed Paris during the War for Tours and then Bordeaux, moved into the Palace.
108	The National Assembly held its meetings in the Opera House.
109	The uprising of the Paris Commune in May, 1871, prevented the French government, under Adolphe Thiers, from returning immediately to Paris.
110	The military operation which suppressed the Commune at the end of the month was directed from Versailles, and the prisoners of the Commune were marched there and put on trial in military courts.
111	In 1875 a second parliamentary body, the French Senate, was created, and held its meetings for the election of a President of the Republic in a new hall created in 1876 in the south wing of the Palace.
112	The French Senate continues to meet in the Palace on special occasions, such as the amendment of the French Constitution.
113	20th centuryThe Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles, 28 June 1919 by William Orpen The end of the 19th and the early 20th century saw the beginning of restoration efforts at the Palace, first led by Pierre de Nolhac, poet and scholar and the first conservator, who began his work in 1892.
114	The conservation and restoration was interrupted by two world wars, but has continued until the present day.
115	The Palace briefly returned to the world stage in June, 1919, when the Treaty of Versailles, formally ending the First World War, was signed in the Hall of Mirrors.
116	Between 1925 and 1928, the American philanthropist and multi-millionaire John D. Rockefeller gave $2,166,000, the equivalent of about thirty million dollars today, to restore and refurnish the palace.
117	More work took place after World War II, with the restoration of the Royal Opera of Versailles.
118	The theater was reopened in 1957, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain.
119	In 1978, parts of the Palace were heavily damaged in a bombing committed by Breton terrorists.
120	The restoration initiatives launched by the Fifth Republic have proven to be perhaps more costly than the expenditures of the palace in the Ancien Régime.
121	Starting in the 1950s, when the museum of Versailles was under the directorship of Gérald van der Kemp, the objective was to restore the palace to its state – or as close to it as possible – in 1789 when the royal family left the palace.
122	Among the early projects was the repair of the roof over the Hall of Mirrors; the publicity campaign brought international attention to the plight of post-war Versailles and garnered much foreign money including a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.
123	Concurrently, in the Soviet Union (Russia since 26 December 1991), the restoration of the Pavlovsk Palace located 25 kilometers from the center of Leningrad – today's Saint Petersburg – brought the attention of French Ministry of Culture, including that of the curator of Versailles.
124	After the war when Soviet authorities were restoring the palace, which had been gutted by the retreating Nazi forces, they recreated the silk fabrics by using preserved 18th-century remnants.
125	When these results and the high quality achieved were brought to the attention of the French Minister of Culture, he revived 18th-century weaving techniques so as to reproduce the silks used in the decoration of Versailles.
126	The two greatest achievements of this initiative are seen today in wall hangings used in the restoration of the chambre de la reine in the grand appartement de reine and the chambre du roi in the appartement du roi.
127	While the design used for the chambre du roi was, in fact, from the original design to decorate the chambre de la reine, it nevertheless represents a great achievement in the ongoing restoration at Versailles.
128	Additionally, this project, which took over seven years to achieve, required several hundred kilograms of silver and gold to complete.
129	One of the more costly endeavours for the museum and France's Fifth Republic has been to repurchase as much of the original furnishings as possible.
130	Consequently, because furniture with a royal provenance – and especially furniture that was made for Versailles – is a highly sought after commodity on the international market, the museum has spent considerable funds on retrieving much of the palace's original furnishings.
131	21st centuryIn 2003, a new restoration initiative – the \"Grand Versailles\" project – was started, which began with the replanting of the gardens, which had lost over 10,000 trees during Hurricane Lothar on 26 December 1999.
132	One part of the initiative, the restoration of the Hall of Mirrors, was completed in 2006.
133	Another major project was the further restoration of the backstage areas Royal Opera of Versailles, which was completed in 2009.
134	Ownership and managementThe Palace of Versailles is owned by the French state.
135	Its formal title is the Public Establishment of the Palace, Museum and National Estate of Versailles Since 1995, it has been run as a Public Establishment, with an independent administration and management supervised by the French Ministry of Culture.
136	The current Chairperson of the Public Establishment is Catherine Pégard.

138	It began with the original château, with the brick and stone and sloping slate mansard roofs of the Louis XIII style used by architect Philibert Le Roy.
139	It then became grander and more monumental, with the addition of the colonnades and flat roofs of the new royal apartments in the French classical or Louis XIV style, as designed by Louis Le Vau and later Jules Hardouin-Mansart.
140	It concluded in the lighter and more graceful neoclassical Louis XVI style of the Petit Trianon, completed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel in 1768.
141	The palace was largely completed by the death of Louis XIV in 1715.
142	The eastern facing palace has a U-shaped layout, with the corps de logis and symmetrical advancing secondary wings terminating with the Dufour Pavilion on the south and the Gabriel Pavilion to the north, creating an expansive cour d'honneur known as the Royal Court (Cour Royale).
143	Flanking the Royal Court are two enormous asymmetrical wings that result in a facade of  in length.
144	Encompassing  the palace has 700 rooms, more than 2,000 windows, 1,250 fireplaces and 67 staircases.
145	The façade of Louis XIII's original château is preserved on the entrance front.
146	Built of red brick and cut stone embellishments, the U-shaped layout surrounds a black-and-white marble courtyard.
147	In the center, a 3-storey avant-corps fronted with eight red marble columns supporting a gilded wrought-iron balcony is surmounted with a triangle of lead statuary surrounding a large clock, whose hands were stopped upon the death of Louis XIV.
148	The rest of the façade is completed with columns, painted and gilded wrought-iron balconies and dozens of stone tables decorated with consoles holding marble busts of Roman emperors.
149	Atop the mansard slate roof are elaborate dormer windows and gilt lead roof dressings that were added by Hardouin-Mansart in 1679–1681.
150	 Inspired by the architecture of baroque Italian villas, but executed in the French classical style, the garden front and wings were encased in white cut ashlar stone known as the enveloppe in 1668-1671 by Le Vau and modified by Hardouin-Mansart in 1678–1679.
151	The exterior features an arcaded, rusticated ground floor, supporting a main floor with round-headed windows divided by reliefs and pilasters or columns.
152	The attic storey has square windows and pilasters and crowned by a balustrade bearing sculptured trophies and flame pots dissimulating a flat roof.
153	Royal ApartmentsPlan of the main floor in the central part of the palace (c. 1742), showing the grand appartement du roi in dark blue, the appartement du roi in medium blue, the petit appartement du roi in light blue, the grand appartement de la reine in yellow, and the petit appartement de la reine in red The construction in 1668–1671 of Le Vau's enveloppe around the outside of Louis XIII's red brick and white stone château added state apartments for the king and the queen.
154	The addition was known at the time as the château neuf (new château).
155	The grands appartements (Grand Apartments, also referred to as the State Apartments) include the grand appartement du roi and the grand appartement de la reine.
156	They occupied the main or principal floor of the château neuf, with three rooms in each apartment facing the garden to the west and four facing the garden parterres to the north and south, respectively.
157	The private apartments of the king (the appartement du roi and the petit appartement du roi) and those of the queen (the petit appartement de la reine) remained in the château vieux (old château).
158	Le Vau's design for the state apartments closely followed Italian models of the day, including the placement of the apartments on the main floor (the piano nobile, the next floor up from the ground level), a convention the architect borrowed from Italian palace design.
159	The king's State Apartment consisted of an enfilade of seven rooms, each dedicated to one of the known planets and their associated titular Roman deity.
160	The queen's apartment formed a parallel enfilade with that of the grand appartement du roi.
161	After the addition of the Hall of Mirrors (1678–1684) the king's apartment was reduced to five rooms (until the reign of Louis XV, when two more rooms were added) and the queen's to four.
162	The queen's apartments served as the residence of three queens of France - Marie-Thérèse d'Autriche, wife of Louis XIV, Marie Leczinska, wife of Louis XV, and Marie-Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI.
163	Additionally, Louis XIV's granddaughter-in-law, Princess Marie-Adélaïde of Savoy, duchesse de Bourgogne, wife of the Petit Dauphin, occupied these rooms from 1697 (the year of her marriage) to her death in 1712.
164	The State Apartments of the KingthumbMeal at the House of Simon the Pharisee by Veronese in the Salon of HerculesThe Salon of AbundanceThe Salon of VenusThe Salon of MercuryThe construction of the Hall of Mirrors between 1678 and 1686 coincided with a major alteration to the State Apartments.
165	They were originally intended as his residence, but the King transformed them into galleries for his finest paintings, and venues for his many receptions for courtiers.
166	During the season from All-Saints Day in November until Easter, these were usually held three times a week, from six to ten in the evening, with various entertainments.
167	The Salon of HerculesThis was originally a chapel.
168	It was rebuilt beginning in 1712 as a showcase for the painting Meal at the House of Simon the Pharisee by Paolo Veronese, which was a gift to Louis XIV from the Republic of Venice in 1664.
169	The painting on the ceiling, The Apotheosis of Hercules, by François Lemoyne, was completed in 1712, and gave the room its name.
170	The Salon of AbundanceThe Salon of Abundance was the antechamber to the Cabinet of Curios (now the Games Room), which displayed Louis XIV's collection of precious jewels and rare objects.
171	Some of the objects in the collection are depicted in René-Antoine Houasse's painting Abundance and Liberality (1683), located on the ceiling over the door opposite the windows.
172	The Salon of VenusThis salon was used for serving light meals during evening receptions.
173	The principal feature in this room is Jean Warin's life-size statue of Louis XIV in the costume of a Roman emperor.
174	On the ceiling in a gilded oval frame is another painting by Houasse, Venus subjugating the Gods and Powers (1672-1681).
175	Trompe l'oeil paintings and sculpture around the ceiling illustrate mythological themes.
176	The Salon of Mercury
177	The Salon of Mercury was the original State Bedchamber when Louis XIV officially moved the court and government to the Palace in 1682.
178	The bed is a replica of the original commissioned by King Louis-Philippe in the 19th century when he turned the Palace into a Museum.
179	The ceiling paintings by the Flemish artist Jean Baptiste de Champaigne depicts the god Mercury in his chariot, drawn by a rooster, and Alexander the Great and Ptolemy surrounded by scholars and philosophers.
180	The Automaton Clock was made for the King by the royal clockmaker Antoine Morand in 1706.
181	When it chimes the hour, figures of Louis XIV and Fame descend from a cloud.
182	Salon of MarsCeiling in the Salon of Apollo, depicting the Sun Chariot of ApolloBust of Louis XIV by Bernini in Salon of DianaThe Salon of MarsThe Salon of Mars was used by the royal guards until 1782, and was decorated on a military theme with helmets and trophies.
183	It was turned into a concert room between 1684 and 1750, with galleries for musicians on either side.
184	Portraits of Louis XV and his Queen, Marie Leszczinska, by the Flemish artist Carle Van Loo decorate the room today.
185	The Salon of ApolloThe Salon of Apollo was the royal throne room under Louis XIV, and was the setting for formal audiences.
186	The eight-foot high silver throne was melted down in 1689 to help pay the costs of an expensive war, and was replaced by a more modest throne of gilded wood.
187	The central painting on the ceiling, by Charles de la Fosse, depicts the Sun Chariot of Apollo, the King's favorite emblem, pulled by four horses and surrounded by the four seasons.
188	The Salon of DianaThe Salon of Diana was used by Louis XIV as a billiards room, and had galleries from which courtiers could watch him play.
189	The decoration of the walls and ceiling depicts scenes from the life of the goddess Diana.
190	The celebrated bust of Louis XIV by Bernini made during the famous sculptor's visit to France in 1665, is on display here.
191	Private apartments of the King and QueenThe King's bedchamberThe Queen's bedchamberThe gilded cabinet of Marie-AntoinetteBilliard Room of Marie-AntoinettePrivate apartments of the KingThe apartments of the King were the heart of the chateau; they were in the same location as the rooms of Louis XIII, the creator of the chateau, on the first floor (second floor US style).
192	They were set aside for the personal use of Louis XIV in 1683.
193	He and his successors Louis XV and Louis XVI used these rooms for official functions, such as the ceremonial lever (\"waking up\") and the coucher (\"going to bed\") of the monarch, which were attended by a crowd of courtiers.
194	The King's apartment was accessed from the Hall of Mirrors from the Oeil de Boeuf antechamber past the Guardroom and the Grand Couvert, the ceremonial room where Louis XIV often took his evening meals, seated alone at a table in front of the fireplace.
195	His spoon, fork, and knife were brought to him in a golden box.
196	The courtiers could watch as he dined.
197	The King's bedchamber had originally been the State Drawing Room and had been used by Queen Marie-Theresa, but after her death in 1701 Louis XIV took it over to use as his own bedroom and died there on September 1, 1715.
198	Both Louis XV and Louis XVI continued to use the bedroom for their official awakening and going to bed.
199	On October 6, 1789, from the balcony of this room Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, joined by the Marquis de Lafayette, looked down on the hostile crowd in the courtyard, shortly before the King was forced to return to Paris.
200	The bed of the King is placed beneath a carved relief by Nicolas Coustou entitled  France watching over the sleeping King.
201	The decoration includes several paintings set into the paneling, including a self-portrait of Antony Van Dyck.
202	Private apartments of The QueenThe petit appartement de la reine is a suite of rooms that were reserved for the personal use of the queen.
203	Originally arranged for the use of the Marie-Thérèse, consort of Louis XIV, the rooms were later modified for use by Marie Leszczyńska and finally for Marie-Antoinette.
204	The Queen's apartments and the King's Apartments were laid out on the same design, each suite having seven rooms.
205	Both suites had ceilings painted with scenes from mythology; the King's ceilings featured male figures, the Queen's featured females.
206	The Grand GalleryThe Peace SalonThe Peace Salon; Louis XV sharing benefits of peace by François LemoyneThe Galerie des Glaces or Hall of MirrorsGuerdirons or candle holders in the Hall of MirrorsRelief of Louis XIV in the Salon of War, by Antoine Coysevox (1715)The Grand Gallery is a set of three highly decorated reception rooms, dedicated to the celebration of the political and military successes of Louis XIV, and used for important ceremonies, celebrations and receptions.
207	The War SalonThe War Salon commemorates the victorious campaign of Louis XIV against the Dutch, which ended in 1678.
208	The centerpiece is an enormous sculpted medallion of Louis XIV, on horseback, crossing the Rhine in 1672, created by Antoine Coysevox.
209	Above the fireplace is a painting of Clio, the Muse of History, recording the exploits of the King.
210	The Hall of MirrorsThe Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors), is perhaps the most famous room in the château of Versailles.
211	It took the place of the rooftop terrace overlooking the gardens which formerly connected the apartments of the King and Queen.
212	The construction of the room began in 1678 and finished in 1689.
213	The gallery is more than  long, and it is lined with 17 wide arcaded mirrors, designed to match and reflect the windows opposite facing the gardens.
214	Charles Le Brun painted thirty scenes of the early reign of Louis XIV on the ceiling.
215	The centerpiece is a painting of the King titled, \"The King Governing Alone\".
216	It shows Louis XIV, facing the powers of Europe, turning away from his pleasures to accept a crown of immortality from Glory, with the encouragement of Mars.
217	The hall was originally furnished with solid silver furniture designed by Le Brun, but these furnishings were melted down in 1689 to help pay for war expenses.
218	The King kept a silver throne, usually located in the Salon of Apollo, which was brought to the Hall of Mirrors for formal ceremonies, such as the welcome of foreign ambassadors, including a delegation from the King of Siam in 1686.
219	It was also used for large events, such as full-dress and masked balls.
220	Light was provided by candelabra on large gilded guerdirons lining the hall.
221	Those on display today were made in 1770 for the marriage of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, based on the moldings of earlier silver versions made by LeBrun that had been melted down.
222	The twenty-four crystal chandeliers were hung only for special occasions.
223	Courtiers gathered in the Hall to watch the King walk from his apartments to the chapel, and sometimes took the occasion to present him with requests.
224	The Peace SalonThe Peace Salon is decorated to illustrate the role of France as the arbiter and peacemaker of Europe under Louis XV.
225	The painting on the ceiling by François Lemoyne, Louis XV offering an olive branch to Europe, illustrates this theme.
226	During the reign of Louis XV, the Queen, Marie Leszczyńska, used this salon as a music room, organizing concerts of secular and religious music each Sunday.
227	Royal ChapelRoyal Chapel seen from the ground floor The Royal Chapel, seen from the Royal GalleryThe Royal Chapel, the tallest building of the PalaceAltar and organ of the Royal ChapelGlory holding a portrait of Louis XV, by Antoine Vassé, in the chapel vestibuleThe Chapel was the last building at Versailles to be completed during the reign of Louis XIV.
228	It was consecrated in 1710, and was dedicated to Louis IX of France, the ancestor and patron saint of the King.
229	Construction was begun by Hardouin-Mansart in 1699, and was completed by de Corte.
230	Daily services, wedding ceremonies, and baptisms were held in this chapel until 1789.
231	Like other royal chapels, it had two levels: the King and family worshipped in the Royal Gallery on the upper level, while ordinary courtiers stood on the ground level.
232	The paintings on the ceiling display scenes depicting the three figures of the trinity.
233	In the center is The Glory of the Father Announcing the Coming of the Messiah by Antoine Coypel, above the altar is The Resurrection of Christ, and above the royal gallery is The Holy Spirit Descending Upon the Virgin and the Apostles.
234	The corridor and vestibule that connected the Chapel and the State Apartments included later art, commissioned by Louis XV, intended to portray the link between Divinity and the King: a statue of Glory Holding the Medallion of Louis XV, by Antoine Vassé; and Royal Magnanimity by Jacques Bousseau.
235	Royal OperaThe Royal BoxFoyer of the Royal OperaThe Royal Opera during the celebration of the marriage of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette (1770)Stage of the Royal OperaCeiling of the opera, painted by Louis Jean-Jacques Durameau
236	The Royal Opera of Versailles was originally commissioned by Louis XIV in 1682 and was to be built at the end of the North Wing with a design by Mansart and Vigarani.
237	However, due to the expense of the King's continental wars, the project was put aside.
238	The idea was revived by Louis XV with a new design by Ange-Jacques Gabriel in 1748, but this also was temporarily put aside.
239	The project was revived and rushed ahead for the planned celebration of the marriage of the Dauphin, the future Louis XVI, and Marie-Antoinette.
240	For economy and speed, the new opera was built almost entirely of wood, which also gave it very high quality acoustics.
241	The wood was painted to resemble marble, and the ceiling was decorated with a painting of the Apollo, the god of the arts, preparing crowns for illustrious artists, by Louis Jean-Jacques Durameau.
242	The sculptor Augustin Pajou added statuary and reliefs to complete the decoration.
243	The new Opera was inaugurated on May 16, 1770, as part of the celebration of the royal wedding.
244	In October 1789, early in the French Revolution, the last banquet for the royal guardsmen was hosted by the King in the opera, before he departed for Paris.
245	Following the Franco-German War in 1871 and then the Paris Commune until 1875, the French National Assembly met in the opera, until the proclamation of the Third French Republic and the return of the government to Paris.
246	Museum of the History of FranceLouis Philippe dedicates the Gallery of Battles, by François Joseph Heim (1837)thumbright200pxThe Gallery of Battles in the Museum of the History of FranceThe Battle of Taillebourg, by Eugène Delacroix (1837)Louis Philippe and his sons pose before the gates of Versailles, by Horace Vernet History Gallery, (1846)
247	Shortly after becoming King in 1830, Louis Philippe I decided to transform the Palace, which was empty of furnishings and in poor repair, into a museum devoted to \"All the Glories of France,\" with paintings and sculpture depicting famous French victories and heroes.
248	The walls of the apartments of the courtiers and lesser members of the royal family on the first floor (second floor U.S. style) were demolished, and turned into a series of several large galleries: the Coronation Room, which displays the celebrated painting of the coronation of Napoleon I by Jacques-Louis David; the Hall of Battles; commemorating French victories with large-scale paintings; and the 1830 room, which celebrated Louis-Philippe's own coming tol power in the French Revolution of 1830.
249	Some paintings were brought from the Louvre, including works depicting events in French history by Philippe de Champaigne, Pierre Mignard, Laurent de La Hyre, Charles Le Brun, Adam Frans van der Meulen, Nicolas de Largillière, Hyacinthe Rigaud, Jean-Antoine Houdon, Jean-Marc Nattier, Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun, Hubert Robert, Thomas Lawrence, Jacques-Louis David, and Antoine-Jean Gros.
250	Others were commissioned especially for the museum by prominent artists of the early 19th century, including Eugène Delacroix, who painted Saint Louis at the French victory over the British in the Battle of Taillebourg in 1242.
251	Other painters featured include Horace Vernet and François Gérard.
252	A monumental painting by Vernet features Louis Philippe himself, with his sons, posing in front of the gates of the Palace.
253	The overthrow of Louis Philippe in 1848 put an end to his grand plans for the museum, but the Gallery of Battles is still as it was, and is passed through by many visitors to the royal apartments and grand salons.
254	Another set of rooms on the first floor has been made into galleries on Louis XIV and his court, displaying furniture, paintings, and sculpture.
255	In recent years, eleven rooms on the ground floor between the Chapel and the Opera have been turned into a history of the palace, with audiovisual displays and models.
256	Gardens and fountainsBassin de Flore (1672-1679)thumbThe Orangerie gardenFountain of Latona, with the Grand Canal in the backgroundAndré Le Nôtre began transforming the park and gardens of Versailles in the early 1660s.
257	They are the finest example of the jardin à la française, or the French formal garden.
258	They were originally designed to be viewed from the terrace on the west side of the palace, and to create a grand perspective that reached to the horizon, illustrating the king's complete dominance over nature.
259	The Parterre d'Eau and the Parterre and Fountain of Latona
260	The features closest to the Palace are the two water parterres, large pools which reflect the facade of the palace.
261	These are decorated with smaller works of sculpture, representing the rivers of France, which are placed so as not to interfere with the reflections in the water.
262	Down a stairway from the Parterre d'Eau is the Latona Fountain, created in 1670, illustrating the story of Latona taken from the Metamorphoses of Ovid.
263	According to the story, when the peasants of Lycia insulted Latona, the mother of Apollo and Diana, the god Jupiter transformed the peasants into frogs.
264	The fountain was begun in 1670 by Le Nôtre, then enlarged and modified by Hardouin-Mansart, who placed the statue of Latona atop a marble pyramid.
265	Fountain of the Chariot of Apollo and the Grand CanalThe Grand Perspective of the palace continues from the Fountain of Latona south along a grassy lane, the Tapis Vert or green carpet, to the Basin of the Chariot of Apollo.
266	Apollo, the sun god, was the emblem of Louis XIV, featured in much of the decoration of the palace.
267	The chariot rising from the water symbolized the rising of the sun.
268	It was designed by Le Brun and made by the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Tuby between 1668 and 1670, cast in iron and then gilded.
269	Beyond the fountain, the Grand Canal extends 1800 meters to the south end of the park.
270	North Parterre, Dragon Basin, and Basin of NeptuneAnother group of formal gardens is located on the north side of the water parterre.
271	It includes two bosquets or groves: the grove of the Three Fountains, The Bosquet of the Arch of Triumph, and north of these, three major fountains, the Pyramid Fountain, Dragon Fountain, and the Neptune Fountain.
272	The fountains in this area all have a maritime or aquatic theme; the Pyramid Fountain is decorated with Tritons, Sirens, dolphins and nymphs.
273	The Dragon Fountain is one of the oldest at Versailles and has the highest jet of water, twenty-seven meters.
274	It is not actually a dragon, but a python, a mythical serpent that was killed by Apollo.
275	The Neptune Fountain was originally decorated only with a circle of large lead basins jetting water; Louis XV added statues of Neptune, Triton and other gods of the sea.
276	South Parterre and the OrangerieThe South Parterre is located beneath the windows of the queen's apartments and on the roof of the Orangerie.
277	It is decorated with box trees and flowers in arabesque patterns.
278	The underground orangerie was designed to hold over a thousand citrus fruit, palms and oleanders, and other southern-climate trees during winter.
279	They are taken out into the gardens from mid-May until mid-October.
280	The Fountains and the Shortage of WaterSupplying water for the fountains of Versailles was a major problem for the royal government.
281	The 18th-century waterworks at Marly— the Machine de Marly that fed the fountains— was possibly the biggest mechanical system of its time.
282	The water came in from afar on monumental stone aqueducts which have long ago fallen into disrepair or been torn down.
283	Some aqueducts, such as the unfinished Canal de l'Eure, which passes through the gardens of the Château de Maintenon, were never completed for want of resources or due to the exigencies of war.
284	Despite enormous investment in canals and machinery for hoisting water, Versailles never had a sufficient water supply for its hundreds of fountains.
285	When the King promenaded in the gardens, fountains were turned on only when the King was approaching them, and turned off after he departed.
286	Today, only a few fountains are supplied with water, and only operate on a very limited schedule.
287	The Bosquets or GrovesThe Three Fountains BosquetThe Ballroom Bosquet The Colonnade BosquetThe largest part of the garden is divided into geometric bosquets, compartment-like groves; eight on the north side of the garden, and six to the south.
288	The bosquets were created for Louis XIV between 1680 and 1690.
289	They were bordered with high trees and carefully trimmed in cubic forms to resemble rooms with walls of greenery.
290	Each bosquet had its own theme and fountains, statuary, grottoes, and other decoration.
291	Some were highly formal, like Hardouin-Mansart's Bosquet de la Colonnade, with a circle of columns alternating with fountains, while others imitated nature.
292	They were often used for concerts or theatrical performances.
293	Some of the early groves were altered beyond recognition by later monarchs, but the most famous bosquets, Le Nôtre's Salle de Bal (literally, \"ballroom\"), also known as the Bosquet des Rocailles (c. 1685), and Hardouin-Mansart's Bosquet de la Colonnade, have both been restored to the way they were under Louis XIV.
294	Other notable groves include Les Dômes, the Bosquet d'Encelade (after Enceladus, c. 1675), the Théâtre d'Eau (Water Theater), and the Bains d'Apollon (Baths of Apollo).
295	Some are now decorated with contemporary works of art.
296	The Grand Trianon and Petit TrianonPeristyle of the Grand TrianonWest facade of the Petit TrianonThe Temple of LoveThe Queen's Theater at the Petit TrianonIn 1668 Louis XIV decided to build a smaller palace some distance from the main palace, where he could spend quieter time away from the crowds and formality of his Court.
297	He purchased a village called Trianon which adjoined the park, and constructed a pavilion covered with blue and white porcelain in the fashionable Chinese style; it was finished in 1670, and became known as the Porcelain Trianon.
298	In 1687, he replaced it with the Grand Trianon, a larger and more classical pavilion designed by Mansart, with a terrace and walls faced with different colored slabs of marble.
299	After the Revolution, the Trianon served as a residence for both Napoleon I and later for King Louis-Philippe when they visited Versailles.
300	It is decorated today largely as it was under Napoleon and Louis-Philippe.
301	The Petit Trianon was created between 1763 and 1768 by Ange-Jacques Gabriel for Louis XV.
302	The square shaped building, with each facade different, was a prototype of Neoclassicism in France.
303	The most ornate facade, with Corinthian columns, faced the French landscape garden.
304	Louis XVI gave the Petit Trianon as a gift to his bride, Marie-Antoinette.
305	She asked the architect Richard Mique and painter Hubert Robert to design a new English-style landscape garden to replace the formal French garden.
306	Not far from the Petit Trianon she had the Rock Pavilion constructed, and added the classical rotunda of the Temple of Love, built in 1777.
307	In 1780, she built a small theater at the Petit Trianon.
308	In her theater she played a part in one of the first performances of the play The Marriage of Figaro by Pierre Beaumarchais, which helped ensure its success.
309	She was at the Petit Trianon in July 1789 when she first heard the news from Paris of the storming of the Bastille and the beginning of the French Revolution.
310	The Hamlet of Marie AntoinetteThe Hamlet of the Queen One of the most celebrated features of the park is the Hameau de la Reine, a small rustic hamlet near the Petit Trianon created for Queen Marie Antoinette between 1783 and 1785 by the royal architect Richard Mique with the help of the painter Hubert Robert.
311	It replaced a botanical garden created by Louis XV, and consisted of twelve structures, ten of which still exist, in the style of villages in Normandy.
312	It was designed for the Queen and her friends to amuse themselves by playing peasants, and included a farmhouse with a dairy, a mill, a boudoir, a pigeon loft, a tower in the form of a lighthouse from which one could fish in the pond, a belvedere, a cascade and grotto, and a luxuriously furnished cottage with a billiard room for the Queen.
313	Modern Political and ceremonial functionsThe palace still serves political functions.
314	Heads of state are regaled in the Hall of Mirrors; the bicameral French Parliament&mdash;consisting of the Senate (Sénat) and the National Assembly (Assemblée nationale)&mdash;meet in joint session (a congress of the French Parliament) in Versailles to revise or otherwise amend the French Constitution, a tradition that came into effect with the promulgation of the 1875 Constitution.
315	For example, the Parliament met in joint session at Versailles to pass constitutional amendments in June 1999 (for domestic applicability of International Criminal Court decisions and for gender equality in candidate lists), in January 2000 (ratifying the Treaty of Amsterdam), and in March 2003 (specifying the \"decentralized organization\" of the French Republic).
316	In 2009, President Nicolas Sarkozy addressed the global financial crisis before a congress in Versailles, the first time that this had been done since 1848, when Charles-Louis Napoleon Bonaparte gave an address before the French Second Republic.
317	Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, President François Hollande gave a speech before a rare joint session of parliament at the Palace of Versailles.
318	This was the third time since 1848 that a French president addressed a joint session of the French Parliament at Versailles.
319	The president of the National Assembly has an official apartment at the Palace of Versailles.
320	CostOne of the most baffling aspects to the study of Versailles is the cost – how much Louis XIV and his successors spent on Versailles.
321	Owing to the nature of the construction of Versailles and the evolution of the role of the palace, construction costs were essentially a private matter.
322	Initially, Versailles was planned to be an occasional residence for Louis XIV and was referred to as the \"king's house\".
323	Accordingly, much of the early funding for construction came from the king's own purse, funded by revenues received from his appanage as well as revenues from the province of New France (Canada), which, while part of France, was a private possession of the king and therefore exempt from the control of the Parliaments.
324	Once Louis XIV embarked on his building campaigns, expenses for Versailles became more of a matter for public record, especially after Jean-Baptiste Colbert assumed the post of finance minister.
325	Expenditures on Versailles have been recorded in the compendium known as the Comptes des bâtiments du roi sous le règne de Louis XIV and which were edited and published in five volumes by Jules Guiffrey in the 19th century.
326	These volumes provide valuable archival material pursuant to the financial expenditure on all aspects of Versailles such as the payments disbursed for many trades as varied as artists and mole catchers.
327	To counter the costs of Versailles during the early years of Louis XIV's personal reign, Colbert decided that Versailles should be the \"showcase\" of France.
328	Accordingly, all materials that went into the construction and decoration of Versailles were manufactured in France.
329	Even the mirrors used in the decoration of the Hall of Mirrors were made in France.
330	While Venice in the 17th century had the monopoly on the manufacture of mirrors, Colbert succeeded in enticing a number of artisans from Venice to make the mirrors for Versailles.
331	However, owing to Venetian proprietary claims on the technology of mirror manufacture, the Venetian government ordered the assassination of the artisans to keep the secrets proprietary to the Venetian Republic.
332	To meet the demands for decorating and furnishing Versailles, Colbert nationalised the tapestry factory owned by the Gobelin family, to become the Manufacture royale des Gobelins.
333	Louis XIV visits the Gobelins with Colbert, 15 October 1667.
334	Tapestry from the series, \"Histoire du roi\" designed by Charles Le Brun and woven between 1667 and 1672.
335	Articles of Louis XIV's silver furniture are seen in this tapestry.
336	In 1667, the name of the enterprise was changed to the Manufacture royale des Meubles de la Couronne.
337	The Gobelins were charged with all decoration needs of the palace, which was under the direction of Charles Le Brun.
338	One of the most costly elements in the furnishing of the grands appartements during the early years of the personal reign of Louis XIV was the silver furniture, which can be taken as a standard – with other criteria – for determining a plausible cost for Versailles.
339	The Comptes meticulously list the expenditures on the silver furniture – disbursements to artists, final payments, delivery – as well as descriptions and weight of items purchased.
340	Entries for 1681 and 1682 concerning the silver balustrade used in the salon de Mercure serve as an example:Year 1681II.

355	Accordingly, the silver balustrade, which contained in excess of one ton of silver, cost in excess of 560,000 livres.
356	It is difficult – if not impossible – to give an accurate rate of exchange between 1682 and today.
357	However, Frances Buckland provides valuable information that provides an idea of the true cost of the expenditures at Versailles during the time of Louis XIV.
358	In 1679, Mme de Maintenon stated that the cost of providing light and food for twelve people for one day amounted to slightly more than 14 livres.
359	In December 1689, to defray the cost of the War of the League of Augsburg, Louis XIV ordered all the silver furniture and articles of silver at Versailles – including chamber pots – sent to the mint to be melted.
360	Clearly, the silver furniture alone represented a significant outlay in the finances of Versailles.
361	While the decoration of the palace was costly, certain other costs were minimised.
362	For example, labour for construction was often low, due largely to the fact that the army during times of peace and during the winter, when wars were not waged, was pressed into action at Versailles.
363	Additionally, given the quality and uniqueness of the items produced at the Gobelins for use and display at Versailles, the palace served as a venue to showcase not only the success of Colbert's mercantilism, but also to display the finest that France could produce.
364	Estimates of the amount spent to build Versailles are speculative.
365	An estimate in 2000 placed the amount spent during the Ancien Régime as US$2 billion, this figure being, in all probability, an under-evaluation.
366	France's Fifth Republic expenditures alone, directed to restoration and maintenance at Versailles, may have surpassed those of the Sun King.

393	Their sixteenth studio album, The Book of Souls, was released on 4 September 2015 to similar success.
394	Despite little radio or television support, Iron Maiden are considered one of the most successful heavy metal bands in history, with The Sunday Times reporting in 2017 that the band have sold over 100 million copies of their albums worldwide.
395	The band won the Ivor Novello Award for international achievement in 2002.
396	, the band have played over 2000 live shows throughout their career.
397	For over 35 years the band have been supported by their famous mascot, \"Eddie\", who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers, as well as in their live shows.
398	HistoryEarly years (1975–1978)The Cart and Horses Pub, located in Maryland Point, Stratford, was where Iron Maiden played some of their first shows in 1976.
399	Iron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 25 December 1975 by bassist Steve Harris shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler.
400	Harris attributed the band's name to a film adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, the title of which reminded him of the iron maiden torture device.
401	After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976, before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in Maryland Point, Stratford.
402	The original line-up was short-lived, with vocalist Paul Day being the first casualty as, according to Harris, he lacked \"energy or charisma on stage\".
403	He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a Kiss fan who used make-up and fake blood during live performances.
404	Wilcock's friend, Dave Murray, was invited to join, much to the dismay of the band's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance.
405	Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976, though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist.
406	Harris and Murray remain the band's longest-standing members and have performed on all of their releases.
407	Dave Murray and Steve Harris in 2008.
408	Harris and Murray are the only members to have performed on all of the band's albums.
409	Iron Maiden recruited yet another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth.
410	Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray, as well as original drummer Ron Matthews.
411	A new line-up was put together, including future Cutting Crew member Tony Moore on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer Barry Purkis (better known today as Thunderstick).
412	A poor performance at the Bridgehouse, a pub located in Canning Town, in November 1977 was the line-up's first and only concert.
413	Afterwards, Iron Maiden fired Purkis and replaced him with Doug Sampson.
414	At the same time, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band's sound.
415	A few months later, Dennis Wilcock decided to leave Iron Maiden to form his own band, V1, and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated.
416	As he preferred to be the band's sole guitarist, Wapram disapproved of Murray's return, and was also dismissed.
417	Harris, Murray, and Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band's new line-up.
418	A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno.
419	Steve Harris stated, \"There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge.\"
420	At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, \"Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own.
421	The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult.
422	\"Record contract and early releases (1978–1981)On New Year's Eve 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a demo, consisting of four songs, at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge.
423	Hoping that the recording would help them secure more gigs, the band presented a copy to Neal Kay, then managing a heavy metal club called \"Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse\", located in Kingsbury Circle, northwest London.
424	Upon hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, \"Prowler\", eventually went to No. 1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in Sounds magazine.
425	A copy was also acquired by Rod Smallwood, who soon became the band's manager, and, as Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as The Soundhouse Tapes, named after the club.
426	Featuring only three tracks (one song, \"Strange World\", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production) all five thousand copies were sold out within weeks.
427	In December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with EMI, and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend, Adrian Smith of Urchin, to join the group as their second guitarist.
428	Due to his commitment to Urchin, Smith declined and Dennis Stratton was hired instead.
429	Shortly afterwards, Doug Sampson left due to health issues, and was replaced by ex-Samson drummer Clive Burr at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December 1979.
430	Iron Maiden's first appearance on an album was on the Metal for Muthas compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of \"Sanctuary\" and \"Wrathchild\".
431	The release led to an ensuing tour which featured several other bands linked with the new wave of British heavy metal.
432	Paul Di'Anno and Steve Harris supporting Judas Priest on their British Steel Tour, 1980 Iron Maiden released their eponymous self-titled album in 1980, which debuted at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart.
433	In addition to the title track (a live version of which would be one of the first music videos aired on MTV), the album includes other early favourites such as \"Running Free\", \"Transylvania\", \"Phantom of the Opera\", and \"Sanctuary\" – which was not on the original UK release, but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters.
434	The band embarked on a headline tour of the UK, before opening for Kiss on their 1980 Unmasked Tour's European leg as well as supporting Judas Priest on select dates.
435	Iron Maiden also appeared, to much acclaim, at the Reading Festival 1980.
436	They were second to top of the bill on the Saturday, with UFO headlining.
437	After the Kiss tour, Dennis Stratton was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences, and was replaced by Adrian Smith in October 1980.
438	In 1981, Iron Maiden released their second studio album, Killers.
439	Containing many tracks written prior to their debut release, only two new songs were written for the record: \"Prodigal Son\" and \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (the latter's title was taken from the short story by Edgar Allan Poe).
440	Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album, the band hired veteran producer Martin Birch, who would go on to work for Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992.
441	The record was followed by the band's first world tour, which included their debut performance in the United States, opening for Judas Priest at The Aladdin Casino in Las Vegas.
442	Success (1981–1985)By 1981, Paul Di'Anno was demonstrating increasingly self-destructive behaviour, particularly due to his drug usage, about which Di'Anno comments, \"it wasn't just that I was snorting a bit of coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day ...
443	the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see my way to the end of it.
444	I knew I'd never last the whole tour.
445	It was too much.\"
446	With his performances waning, Di'Anno was immediately dismissed following the Killer World Tour, at which point the band had already selected his replacement.
447	After a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the Reading Festival, Bruce Dickinson, previously of Samson, auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired.
448	 The following month, Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy, as well as a one-off show at the Rainbow Theatre in the UK.
449	For the last show, and in anticipation of their forthcoming album, the band played \"Children of the Damned\" and \"22 Acacia Avenue\", introducing fans to the sound towards which they were progressing.
450	In 1982, Iron Maiden released their third studio album, The Number of the Beast, which gave the band their first UK Albums Chart No. 1 record and additionally became a Top Ten hit in many other countries.
451	At the time, Dickinson was in the midst of legal difficulties with Samson's management, and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits, although he still made what he described as a \"moral contribution\" to \"Children of the Damned\", \"The Prisoner\" and \"Run to the Hills\".
452	For the second time the band embarked on a world tour, dubbed The Beast on the Road, during which they visited North America, Japan, Australia, and Europe, including a headline appearance at the Reading Festival.
453	A new and hugely successful chapter in Iron Maiden's future was cemented; in 2010 The New York Times reported that the album had sold over 14 million copies worldwide.
454	The Beast on the Road's US leg proved controversial when an American conservative political lobbying group claimed that Iron Maiden were Satanic because of the new album's title track, to the point where a group of Christian activists destroyed Iron Maiden records as a protest against the band.
455	In recent years, Dickinson stated that the band treated this as \"silliness\", and that the demonstrations in fact gave them \"loads of publicity\".
456	Nicko McBrain has been Iron Maiden's drummer since 1982 In December 1982, drummer Clive Burr was fired from the band and replaced by Nicko McBrain, who previously played for Trust.
457	Although Harris stated that his dismissal took place because his live performances were affected by offstage activities, Burr objected to this, and claimed that he was unfairly ousted from the band.
458	Soon afterwards, the band journeyed for the first time to The Bahamas to record the first of three consecutive albums at Compass Point Studios.
459	In 1983, they released their fourth studio album, Piece of Mind, which reached the No. 3 spot in the UK, and was the band's debut in the North American charts, reaching No. 70 on the Billboard 200.
460	Piece of Mind includes the successful singles, \"The Trooper\" and \"Flight of Icarus\", the latter of which being particularly notable as one of the band's few songs to gain substantial airplay in the US.
461	Soon after the success of Piece of Mind and its supporting tour, the band released their fifth studio album, Powerslave, on 9 September 1984.
462	The album features the singles \"2 Minutes to Midnight\", \"Aces High\", as well as \"Rime of The Ancient Mariner\", based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem of the same name, and running over 13 minutes in length.
463	The tour, following the album, dubbed the World Slavery Tour, was the band's largest to date, and consisted of 193 shows in 28 countries over 13 months, playing to an estimated 3,500,000 people.
464	Many shows were played back-to-back in the same city, such as in Long Beach, California, where the band played four consecutive concerts.
465	Their first live album, Live After Death, was recorded, which became a critical and commercial success, peaking at No. 4 in the UK.
466	Iron Maiden also made their debut appearance in South America, where they co-headlined (with Queen) the Rock in Rio festival to an estimated 300,000 in attendance.
467	The tour was physically gruelling for the band, who demanded six months off when it ended (although this was later reduced to four months).
468	This was the first substantial break in the group's history, including the cancellation of a proposed supporting tour for the new live album, with Bruce Dickinson threatening to quit unless the tour ended.
469	Experimentation (1986–1989)Returning from their time off, the band adopted a different style for their 1986 studio album, entitled Somewhere in Time, featuring, for the first time in the band's history, synthesised bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound.
470	The release charted well across the world, particularly with the single \"Wasted Years\", but notably included no writing credits from Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band.
471	While Dickinson was focused on his own music, guitarist Adrian Smith, who typically collaborated with the vocalist, was \"left to [his] own devices\" and began writing songs on his own, coming up with \"Wasted Years\", \"Sea of Madness\", and \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", the last of which would be the album's second single.
472	The experimentation evident on Somewhere in Time continued on their next album, entitled Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which was released in 1988.
473	A concept album, based on the 1987 novel Seventh Son by Orson Scott Card, would be the band's first record to include keyboards, performed by Harris and Smith, as opposed to guitar synthesisers on the previous release.
474	After his contributions were not used for Somewhere in Time, Dickinson's enthusiasm was renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album.
475	Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's second album to hit No. 1 in the UK charts, although it only achieved a Gold certification in the US, in contrast to its four predecessors.
476	During the following tour, the band headlined the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park for the first time on 20 August 1988, playing to the largest crowd in the festival's history, with an estimated 107,000 in attendance.
477	Also included on the bill were Kiss, David Lee Roth, Megadeth, Guns N' Roses, and Helloween.
478	The festival was marred, however, by the deaths of two fans in a crowd-surge during the aforementioned Guns N' Roses performance; the following year's festival was cancelled as a result.
479	The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the NEC Arena, Birmingham recorded for a live video, entitled Maiden England.
480	Throughout the tour, Harris' bass technician, Michael Kenney, provided live keyboards.
481	Kenney has acted as the band's live keyboard player ever since, also performing on the band's four following albums before Harris took over as the group's sole studio keyboardist from 2000's Brave New World.
482	Upheaval (1989–1994)During another break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band ASAP, entitled Silver and Gold, and vocalist Bruce Dickinson began work on a solo album with former Gillan guitarist Janick Gers, releasing Tattooed Millionaire in 1990, followed by a tour.
483	At the same time, to mark the band's ten-year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released a compilation collection, The First Ten Years, a series of ten CDs and double 12-inch singles.
484	Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one-by-one, each containing two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the original B-sides.
485	Soon afterwards, Iron Maiden regrouped to work on a new studio record.
486	During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris, regarding the direction the band should be taking, disagreeing with the \"stripped down\" style that they were leaning towards.
487	Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson's solo project, was chosen to replace Smith, and became the band's first new member in seven years.
488	The album, No Prayer for the Dying, was released in October 1990, and contained \"Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter\", the band's first (and to date, only) UK Singles Chart No. 1, originally recorded by Dickinson's solo outfit for the soundtrack to A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child.
489	The song was banned by the BBC and only a 90 sec live clip on Top of the Pops was shown.
490	After another tour and some more time off, the band recorded their next studio album, Fear of the Dark, which was released in 1992 and included the stand-out title track, which is now a regular fixture in the band's concert setlists.
491	Achieving their third No. 1 in the UK albums chart, the disc also featured the No. 2 single \"Be Quick or Be Dead\" and the No. 21 single \"From Here to Eternity\".
492	The album featured the first songwriting by Gers, and no collaboration at all between Harris and Dickinson on songs.
493	The extensive worldwide tour that followed included their first ever Latin American leg (after a single concert during the World Slavery Tour), and headlining the Monsters of Rock festivals in seven European countries.
494	Iron Maiden's second performance at Donington Park, to an audience of 68,500 (the attendance was capped after the incident in 1988), was filmed for the audio and video release, Live at Donington, and featured a guest appearance by Adrian Smith, who joined the band to perform \"Running Free\".
495	In 1993, Dickinson left the band to further pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a farewell tour and two live albums (later re-released in one package).
496	The first, A Real Live One, featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and was released in March 1993.
497	The second, A Real Dead One, featured songs from 1980 to 1984, and was released after Dickinson had left the band.
498	The tour did not go well, with Steve Harris claiming that Dickinson would only perform properly for high-profile shows, and that at several concerts, he would only mumble into the microphone.
499	Dickinson denied that he was under-performing, stating that it was impossible to \"make like Mr Happy Face if the vibe wasn't right\", saying that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour.
500	He played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993, which was filmed, broadcast by the BBC, and released on video under the name Raising Hell.
501	Blaze Bayley era, The X Factor and Virtual XI (1994–1999)In 1994, the band listened to hundreds of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing Blaze Bayley, formerly of the band Wolfsbane, who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them.
502	Harris' preferred choice from the outset, Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor, which ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.
503	After a two-year hiatus (as well as a three-year hiatus from studio releases – a record for the band at the time), Iron Maiden returned in 1995.
504	Releasing their next studio album, The X Factor, the band had their lowest chart position since 1981 for an album in the UK (debuting at No. 8), although it would go on to win Album of the Year awards in France and Germany.
505	 The record included the 11-minute epic \"Sign of the Cross\", the band's longest song since \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", as well as the singles, \"Man on the Edge\", based on the film Falling Down, and \"Lord of the Flies\", based on the novel of the same name.
506	The release is notable for its \"dark\" tone, inspired by Steve Harris' divorce.
507	The band toured for the rest of 1995 and 1996, playing for the first time in Israel and South Africa, and ending in the Americas.
508	After the tour, Iron Maiden released a compilation album, Best of the Beast.
509	The band's first compilation
510	, it included a new single, \"Virus\", in which the lyrics attack the critics, who had recently written off the band.
511	In 1998, Iron Maiden released Virtual XI, whose chart scores were the band's lowest to date, failing to score one million worldwide sales for the first time in the band's history.
512	The album peaked at No. 16in the UK; the band's lowest for a new studio record.
513	 At the same time, Steve Harris assisted in remastering the band's entire discography, up to and including Live at Donington (which was given a mainstream release for the first time).
514	Bayley's tenure in Iron Maiden ended in January 1999 when he was asked to leave during a band meeting.
515	The dismissal took place due to issues Bayley had experienced with his voice during the Virtual XI World Tour, although Janick Gers stated that this was partly the band's fault for forcing him to perform songs, which were beyond his natural register.
516	Return of Dickinson and Smith, Brave New World (1999–2002)Adrian Smith (left) re-joined Iron Maiden in 1999, resulting in a three guitar line-up.
517	While the group were considering a replacement for Bayley, Rod Smallwood convinced Steve Harris to invite Bruce Dickinson back into the band.
518	Although Harris admitted that he \"wasn't really into it\" at first, he then thought, \"'Well, if the change happens, who should we get?'
519	The thing is, we know Bruce and we know what he's capable of, and you think, 'Well, better the devil you know.'
520	I mean, we got on well professionally for, like, eleven years, and so ... after I thought about it, I didn't really have a problem with it.
521	\"The band entered into talks with Dickinson, who agreed to rejoin during a meeting in Brighton in January 1999, along with guitarist Adrian Smith, who was telephoned a few hours later.
522	With Gers, Smith's replacement, remaining, Iron Maiden now had a three-guitar line-up, and embarked on a hugely successful reunion tour.
523	Dubbed The Ed Hunter Tour, it tied in with the band's newly released greatest hits collection, Ed Hunter, whose track listing was decided by a poll on the group's website, and also contained a computer game of the same name starring the band's mascot.
524	One of Dickinson's primary concerns on rejoining the group \"was whether we would in fact be making a real state-of-the-art record and not just a comeback album,\" which eventually took the form of 2000's Brave New World.
525	Having disliked the results from Harris' personal studio, Barnyard Studios located on his property in Essex, which had been used for the last four Iron Maiden studio albums, the band recorded the new release at Guillaume Tell Studios in Paris, France in November 1999 with producer Kevin Shirley.
526	Thematic influences continued with \"The Wicker Man\" – based on the 1973 British cult film of the same name – and \"Brave New World\" – title taken from the Aldous Huxley novel of the same name.
527	The album furthered the more progressive and melodic sound present in some earlier recordings, with elaborate song structures and keyboard orchestration.
528	The world tour that followed consisted of well over 100 dates and culminated on 19 January 2001 in a show at the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil, where Iron Maiden played to an audience of around 250,000.
529	While the performance was being produced for a CD and DVD release in March 2002, under the name Rock in Rio, the band took a year off from touring, during which they played three consecutive shows at Brixton Academy in aid of former drummer Clive Burr, who had recently announced that he had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.
530	The band performed two further concerts for Burr's MS Trust Fund charity in 2005, and 2007, before his death in 2013.
531	Dance of Death and A Matter of Life and Death (2003–2007)Following their Give Me Ed... 'Til I'm Dead Tour in the summer of 2003, Iron Maiden released Dance of Death, their thirteenth studio album, which was met by worldwide critical and commercial success.
532	Produced by Kevin Shirley, now the band's regular producer, many critics also felt that this release matched up to their earlier efforts, such as Killers, Piece of Mind and The Number of the Beast.
533	As usual, historical, and literary references were present, with \"Montségur\" in particular being about the Cathar stronghold conquered in 1244, and \"Paschendale\" relating to the significant battle which took place during The First World War.
534	During the following tour, the band's performance at Westfalenhalle, in Dortmund, Germany, was recorded and released in August 2005 as a live album and DVD, entitled Death on the Road.
535	In 2005, the band announced the Eddie Rips Up the World Tour, which, tying in with their 2004 DVD entitled The History of Iron Maiden – Part 1: The Early Days, only featured material from their first four albums.
536	As part of this celebration of their earlier years, \"The Number of the Beast\" single was re-released and went straight to No. 3 in the UK Chart.
537	The tour included many headlining stadium and festival dates, including a performance at Ullevi Stadium in Sweden to an audience of almost 60,000.
538	This concert was also broadcast live on satellite television all over Europe to approximately 60 million viewers.
539	Following this run of European shows, the band co-headlined the US festival tour, Ozzfest, with Black Sabbath, their final performance at which earned international press coverage after their show was sabotaged by singer Ozzy Osbourne's family, who took offence to Dickinson's remarks against reality-TV.
540	The band completed the tour by headlining the Reading and Leeds Festivals on the 26–28 August, and the RDS Stadium in Ireland on 31 August.
541	For the second time, the band played a charity show for The Clive Burr MS Trust Fund, which took place at the Hammersmith Apollo.
542	The same year, the band were inducted into the Hollywood RockWalk in Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles.
543	Vocalist Bruce Dickinson during A Matter of Life and Death World Tour.
544	Throughout the tour's first leg, the band played the A Matter of Life and Death album in its entirety.
545	At the end of 2005, Iron Maiden began work on A Matter of Life and Death, their fourteenth studio album, released in autumn 2006.
546	While not a concept album, war and religion are recurring themes in the lyrics, as well as in the cover artwork.
547	The release was a critical and commercial success, earning the band their first top ten in the Billboard 200 and receiving the Album of the Year award at the 2006 Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards.
548	A supporting tour followed, during which they played the album in its entirety; response to this was mixed.
549	The second part of the \"A Matter of Life and Death\" tour, which took place in 2007, was dubbed \"A Matter of the Beast\" to celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Number of the Beast album, and included appearances at several major festivals worldwide.
550	The tour opened in the Middle East with the band's first performance in Dubai at the Dubai Desert Rock Festival, after which they played to over 30,000 people at the Bangalore Palace Grounds, marking the first concert by any major heavy metal band in the Indian sub-continent.
551	The band went on to play a string of European dates, including an appearance at Download Festival, their fourth headline performance at Donington Park, to approximately 80,000 people.
552	On 24 June they ended the tour with a performance at London's Brixton Academy in aid of The Clive Burr MS Trust fund.
553	Somewhere Back in Time World Tour and Flight 666 (2007–2009)On 5 September 2007, the band announced their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour, which tied in with the DVD release of their Live After Death album.
554	The setlist for the tour consisted of successes from the 1980s, with a specific emphasis on the Powerslave era for set design.
555	The first part of the tour, commencing in Mumbai, India on 1 February 2008, consisted of 24 concerts in 21 cities, travelling nearly 50,000 miles in the band's own chartered aeroplane, named \"Ed Force One\".
556	They played their first ever concerts in Costa Rica and Colombia and their first shows in Australia and Puerto Rico since 1992.
557	Iron Maiden performing in Toronto during the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour 2008.
558	The stage set largely emulated that of the World Slavery Tour 1984–85.
559	The tour led to the release of a new compilation album, entitled Somewhere Back in Time, which included a selection of tracks from their 1980 eponymous debut to 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, as well as several live versions from Live After Death.
560	The Somewhere Back in Time World Tour continued with two further legs in the US and Europe in the summer of 2008, during which the band used a more expansive stage-set, including further elements of the original Live After Death show.
561	With the sole UK concert taking place at Twickenham Stadium, this would be the first time the band would headline a stadium in their own country.
562	The three 2008 legs of the tour were remarkably successful; it was the second highest-grossing tour of the year for a British artist.
563	The last part of the tour took place in February and March 2009, with the band, once again, using \"Ed Force One\".
564	The final leg included the band's first ever appearances in Peru and Ecuador, as well as their return to Venezuela and New Zealand after 17 years.
565	The band also played another show in India (their third in the country within a span of 2 years) at the Rock in India festival to a crowd of 20,000.
566	At their concert in São Paulo on 15 March, Dickinson announced on stage that it was the largest non-festival show of their career, with an overall attendance of 63,000 people.
567	The final leg ended in Florida on 2 April after which the band took a break.
568	Overall, the tour reportedly had an attendance of over two million people worldwide over both years.
569	At the 2009 BRIT Awards, Iron Maiden won the award for best British live act.
570	Voted for by the public, the band reportedly won by a landslide.
571	On 20 January 2009, the band announced that they were to release a full-length documentary film in select cinemas on 21 April 2009.
572	Entitled Iron Maiden: Flight 666, it was filmed during the first part of the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour between February and March 2008.
573	Flight 666 was co-produced by Banger Productions and was distributed in cinemas by Arts Alliance Media and EMI, with D&E Entertainment sub-distributing in the US.
574	The film went on to have a Blu-ray, DVD, and CD release in May and June, topping the music DVD charts in 22 countries.
575	The Final Frontier and Maiden England World Tour (2010–2014)
576	Following announcements that the band had begun composition of new material and booked studio time in early 2010 with Kevin Shirley producing, The Final Frontier was announced on 4 March.
577	The album, the band's fifteenth, was released on 16 August, garnering critical acclaim and the band's greatest commercial success in their history, reaching No. 1 in twenty-eight countries worldwide.
578	Although Steve Harris had been quoted in the past as claiming that the band would only produce fifteen studio releases, band members have since confirmed that there will be at least one further record.
579	The album's supporting tour saw the band perform 98 shows across the globe to an estimated audience of over 2 million, including their first visits to Singapore, Indonesia, and South Korea, before concluding in London on 6 August 2011.
580	As the tour's 2010 leg preceded The Final Frontier's release, the band made \"El Dorado\" available as a free download on 8 June, which would go on to win the award for Best Metal Performance at the 2011 Grammy Awards on 13 February 2011.
581	It was the band's first win following two previous Grammy nominations (\"Fear of the Dark\" in 1994 and \"The Wicker Man\" in 2001).
582	On 15 March, a new compilation to accompany 2009's Somewhere Back in Time was announced.
583	Entitled From Fear to Eternity, the original release date was set at 23 May, but was later delayed to 6 June.
584	The double disc set covers the period 1990–2010 (the band's most recent eight studio albums), and, as on Somewhere Back in Time, live versions with Bruce Dickinson were included in place of original recordings which featured other vocalists, in this case Blaze Bayley.
585	In a press release regarding From Fear to Eternity, band manager Rod Smallwood revealed that Iron Maiden would release a new concert video to DVD in 2011, filmed in Santiago, Chile and Buenos Aires, Argentina during The Final Frontier World Tour.
586	On 17 January 2012, the band announced that the new release, entitled En Vivo!, based on footage from the Chile concert, would be made available worldwide on CD, LP, DVD, and Blu-ray on 26 March, except for the United States and Canada (where it was released on 27 March).
587	In addition to the concert footage, the video release includes an 88-minute tour documentary, entitled Behind The Beast, containing interviews with the band and their crew.
588	In December 2012, one song from the release (\"Blood Brothers\") was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards.
589	On 15 February 2012, the band announced the Maiden England World Tour 2012–14, which was based around the video of the same name.
590	The tour commenced in North America in the summer of 2012 and was followed by further dates in 2013 and 2014, which included the band's record-breaking fifth headline performance at Donington Park, their first show at the newly built national stadium in Stockholm, a return to the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil, and their debut appearance in Paraguay.
591	In August 2012, Steve Harris stated that the Maiden England video would be re-issued in 2013, with a release date later set for 25 March 2013 in DVD, CD, and LP formats under the title Maiden England '88.
592	The Book of Souls and Legacy of the Beast (2015–present)Following confirmation from the group that 2010's The Final Frontier would not be their last album, Bruce Dickinson revealed plans for a sixteenth studio record in July 2013, with a potential release date in 2015.
593	In February 2015, drummer Nicko McBrain revealed that a new album had been completed, although the release was put on hold as Dickinson was recovering from treatment for a cancerous tumour found on his tongue.
594	On 15 May, after Dickinson was cleared for activities, manager Rod Smallwood confirmed that the album would be released in 2015, although the band would not tour until 2016 to allow Dickinson to continue recuperating.
595	 On 18 June 2015, the band's website announced its title, The Book of Souls, and confirmed a release date of 4 September 2015.
596	It is the band's first original studio album not to be issued by EMI outside North America, following Parlophone's acquisition by Warner Music Group in 2013.
597	A critical and commercial success, it received positive reviews and became the band's fifth UK No. 1 album.
598	Smith, Harris, Murray and Gers performing in 2017.
599	The new record was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris, which they had previously used for 2000's Brave New World, with regular producer Kevin Shirley in late summer 2014.
600	With a total run time of 92 minutes, it is the group's first double studio album.
601	In addition, the release's closing song, \"Empire of the Clouds\", penned by Dickinson, surpassed \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" (from 1984's Powerslave) as Iron Maiden's longest song, at 18 minutes in length.
602	A music video for the song \"Speed of Light\" was issued on 14 August.
603	In February 2016, the band embarked on The Book of Souls World Tour, which saw them play concerts in 35 countries in North and South America, Asia, Australasia, Africa, and Europe, including their first ever performances in China, El Salvador, and Lithuania.
604	As with 2008-09's Somewhere Back in Time World Tour and 2010-11's The Final Frontier World Tour, the group travelled in a customised aeroplane, flown by Dickinson and nicknamed \"Ed Force One\", although they used a Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet.
605	The band completed the tour in 2017 with further European and North American shows.
606	On 20 September 2017, The Book of Souls: Live Chapter was announced.
607	Recorded throughout The Book of Souls World Tour, it was released on 17 November 2017.
608	In the summer of 2016, the group launched a mobile game, Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast.
609	Inspired by the game's title, the band would undertake the Legacy of the Beast World Tour, commencing in Europe in 2018, with North and South American shows following in 2019.
610	Image and legacyIron Maiden were ranked No. 24 in VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\", No. 4 in MTV's \"Top 10 Greatest Heavy Metal Bands of All Time\" and No. 3 in VH1 Classic's \"Top 20 Metal Bands\".
611	 The band also won the Ivor Novello Award for international achievement in 2002 and were inducted into the Hollywood RockWalk whilst touring in the US in 2005.
612	Iron Maiden frequently use the slogan \"Up the Irons\" in their disc liner notes, and the phrase can also be seen on several T-shirts officially licensed by the band.
613	It is a paraphrase of \"Up the Hammers\", the phrase which refers to the London football club, West Ham United, of which founder Steve Harris is a fan.
614	Iron Maiden's mascot, Eddie, is a perennial fixture in the band's science fiction and horror-influenced album cover art, as well as in live shows.
615	Originally a papier-mâché mask incorporated in their backdrop which would squirt fake blood during their live shows, the name would be transferred to the character featured in the band's debut album cover, created by Derek Riggs.
616	Eddie was painted exclusively by Riggs until 1992, at which point the band began using artwork from numerous other artists as well, including Melvyn Grant.
617	Eddie is also featured in the band's first-person shooter video game, Ed Hunter, as well as their mobile role-playing game, Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast, in addition to numerous T-shirts, posters and other band-related merchandise.
618	In 2008, he was awarded the \"Icon Award\" at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods, while Gibson.com describes him as \"the most recognisable metal icon in the world and one of the most versatile too\".
619	Iron Maiden's distinct logo has adorned all of the band's releases since their debut, 1979's The Soundhouse Tapes EP.
620	The typeface originates with Vic Fair's poster design for the 1976 science fiction film, The Man Who Fell to Earth, also used by Gordon Giltrap, although Steve Harris claims that he designed it himself, using his abilities as an architectural draughtsman.
621	Influence on other artists
622	According to Guitar World, Iron Maiden's music has \"influenced generations of newer metal acts, from legends like Metallica to current stars like Avenged Sevenfold,\" with Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich commenting that he has \"always had an incredible amount of respect and admiration for them.\"
623	Kerry King of Slayer stated that \"they meant so much to [him] in their early days\" and Scott Ian of Anthrax said that \"they had a major impact on [his] life.
624	\"M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold stated that Iron Maiden \"are by far the best live band in the world and their music is timeless\", while Trivium singer Matt Heafy comments that \"without Iron Maiden, Trivium surely wouldn't exist\".
625	Slipknot and Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor said that \"Steve Harris does more with four fingers than I've ever seen anybody do.
626	And Bruce Dickinson?
627	Dude!
628	To me, he was the quintessential old-school heavy metal singer.
629	He could hit notes that were just sick, and he was a great showman.
630	Everything made me a fan.
631	And there wasn't a dude that I hung out with that wasn't trying to draw Eddie on their schoolbooks\", while their music also helped Jesper Strömblad of In Flames to pioneer the melodic death metal genre, stating that he had wanted to combine death metal with Iron Maiden's melodic guitar sounds.
632	Other heavy metal artists who cite the band as an influence include Chris Jericho, a WWE wrestler and lead singer of Fozzy, Cam Pipes, lead vocalist of 3 Inches of Blood, Vitaly Dubinin, bassist of Aria, and Mikael Åkerfeldt, guitarist and lead vocalist of Opeth.
633	Both current and former Dream Theater members John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy have stated that Iron Maiden were one of their biggest influences when their band first formed.
634	Appearance in media
635	The band's name has been mentioned prominently in several songs, such as the singles \"Teenage Dirtbag\" by Wheatus, \"Back to the 80's\" by Danish dance-pop band Aqua.
636	and \"Fat Lip\" by Sum 41.
637	Iron Maiden have also been referenced in Weezer's \"Heart Songs\" (from their 2008 self-titled \"Red\" album), Blues Traveler's \"Psycho Joe\" (from 1997's Straight on till Morning), and NOFX's \"Eddie, Bruce and Paul\" (from their 2009 album Coaster), which Sputnikmusic describes as \"a humorous retelling of Paul DiAnno's departure\".
638	In 2008, Kerrang!
639	released Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden, an album composed of Iron Maiden cover songs performed by Metallica, Machine Head, Dream Theater, Trivium, Coheed and Cambria, Avenged Sevenfold, and other groups influenced by the band.
640	In 2010, Maiden uniteD, an acoustic tribute band consisting of members of Ayreon, Threshold and Within Temptation, released Mind the Acoustic Pieces, a re-interpretation of the entire Piece of Mind album.
641	Many other Iron Maiden cover albums exist (each featuring various artists), including piano, electro, string quartet and hip-hop tributes.
642	Iron Maiden songs have been featured in the soundtracks of several video games, including Carmageddon 2, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City, Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, SSX on Tour and Madden NFL 10.
643	Their music also appears in the Guitar Hero and Rock Band series of rhythmic video games.
644	Iron Maiden songs have also appeared in films, such as Phenomena (entitled Creepers in the US), and Murder by Numbers; while MTV's animated duo Beavis and Butt-Head have commented favourably on the band several times.
645	Transformers author Bill Forster is an avowed Iron Maiden fan and made several Iron Maiden references, including song lyrics and the phrase \"Up the Irons\" in his books, including The Ark series and The AllSpark Almanac series.
646	Claims of Satanic referencesIn 1982, the band released one of their most popular, controversial and acclaimed albums, The Number of the Beast.
647	The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as Satanists, encouraging people to destroy copies of the release.
648	The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later commented that Christians initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers through fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes.
649	The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.
650	Contrary to the accusations, the band have always denied the notion that they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the Live After Death concert video.
651	Steve Harris has since commented that, \"It was mad.
652	They completely got the wrong end of the stick.
653	They obviously hadn't read the lyrics.
654	They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists.\"
655	Harris has also stated that \"The Number of the Beast\" song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching Damien: Omen II, and also influenced by Robert Burns' Tam o' Shanter.
656	Furthermore, the band's drummer, Nicko McBrain, has been a born-again Christian since 1999.
657	Ed Force OneThe band's former Ed Force One, a Boeing 757-200.
658	For their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour in 2008 and 2009, Iron Maiden commissioned an Astraeus Airlines Boeing 757 as transport.
659	The aeroplane was converted into a combi configuration, which enabled it to carry the band, their crew and stage production, thereby allowing the group to perform in countries which were previously deemed unreachable logistically.
660	It was also repainted with a special Iron Maiden livery, which the airline decided to retain after receiving positive feedback from customers.
661	Iron Maiden's Ed Force One, a Boeing 747-400, as used during The Book of Souls World Tour in 2016.
662	The aircraft, named \"Ed Force One\" after a competition on the band's website, was flown by Dickinson, as he was also a commercial airline pilot for Astraeus, and plays a major role in the award-winning documentary, Iron Maiden: Flight 666, which was released in cinemas in 42 countries in April 2009.
663	A different aeroplane (registered G-STRX) was used for The Final Frontier World Tour in 2011 with altered livery, adopting the artwork of The Final Frontier album, and features heavily in the 2012 documentary \"Behind the Beast\".
664	For The Book of Souls World Tour in 2016, the band upgraded to an ex-Air France Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet, supplied by Air Atlanta Icelandic (registered TF-AAK) and customised by Volga-Dnepr Gulf, which allows for more space without the aircraft having to undergo a significant conversion to carry their equipment.
665	Musical style and influencesSteve Harris, Iron Maiden's bassist and primary songwriter, has stated that his influences include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull, Thin Lizzy, UFO and Wishbone Ash.
666	In 2010 Harris stated, \"I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, all they have to do is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album.
667	Thin Lizzy too, but not as much.
668	And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull.
669	So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it.\"
670	In 2004, Harris explained that the band's \"heaviness\" was inspired by \"Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in.\"
671	On top of this, Harris developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as \"more like a rhythm guitar,\" cited as responsible for the band's galloping style, heard in such songs as \"The Trooper\" and \"Run to the Hills.
672	\"The band's guitarists, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, and Janick Gers, each have their own individual influences and playing style.
673	Dave Murray is known for his legato technique which, he claims, \"evolved naturally.
674	I'd heard Jimi Hendrix using legato when I was growing up, and I liked that style of playing.\"
675	Stating that he \"was inspired by blues rock rather than metal,\" Adrian Smith was influenced by Johnny Winter and Pat Travers, leading to him becoming a \"melodic player.\"
676	Janick Gers, on the other hand, prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by Ritchie Blackmore, which he claims is in contrast to Smith's \"rhythmic\" sound.
677	Singer Bruce Dickinson, who typically works in collaboration with guitarist Adrian Smith, has an operatic vocal style, inspired by Arthur Brown, Peter Hammill, Ian Anderson and Ian Gillan, and is often considered to be one of the best heavy metal vocalists of all time.
678	Although Nicko McBrain has only received one writing credit, on the Dance of Death album, Harris often relies on him while developing songs.
679	Adrian Smith commented, \"Steve loves playing with him.
680	[They] used to work for hours going over these bass and drum patterns.
681	\"Throughout their career, the band's style has remained largely unchanged, in spite of the addition of guitar synthesisers on 1986's Somewhere in Time, keyboards on 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, and an attempt to return to the \"stripped down\" production of their earlier material on  No Prayer for the Dying.
682	In recent years, however, the band have begun using more progressive elements in their songs, which Steve Harris describes as not progressive \"in the modern sense, but like Dream Theater, more in a 70s way\".
683	According to Harris, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was the band's first album which was \"more progressive\", while they would only return to this style from 1995's The X Factor, which he states is \"like an extension of Seventh Son..., in the sense of the progressive element to it\".
684	The development contrasts with the band's raw-sounding earlier material, which AllMusic states was \"clearly drawing from elements of punk rock\", although Harris firmly denies this.

722	Its origins come from Dunn's first documentary Metal: A Headbanger's Journey, which included the acclaimed \"Heavy Metal Family Tree.\"
723	SummaryMetal Evolution is broken down into episodes about a different piece of metal history.
724	The series includes interviews with and about Alice Cooper, Slash, Lemmy, Rob Zombie, members of Megadeth, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Slayer, Judas Priest, Van Halen, Whitesnake, Def Leppard, The Stooges, ZZ Top, Soundgarden, Mötley Crüe, Poison, Rage Against the Machine, Alice in Chains, Korn, Slipknot, Lamb of God and more.
725	History
726	The series was created after feedback about Metal: A Headbanger's Journey debuted.
727	\"Some people said they wished that film was eight hours long,\" Dunn said.
728	The \"Heavy Metal Family Tree\" from the documentary heavily influenced the Metal Evolution series, with the Banger Films official blog noting that using the 26-subgenre chart as a \"road map, host/producer and metalhead turned anthropologist Sam Dunn, crisscrossed the globe exploring the vast history of heavy metal across its 40+ year history and beyond.\"
729	EpisodesEp #TitleAirdateHeavy Metal Family TreeFor Metal Evolution, Sam Dunn presented a new, updated version of his \"Heavy Metal Family Tree,\" a 26-subgenre chart that mapped out metal's various subgenres that have spawned over the course of its 40-year history.
730	This new, more elaborate version included a \"Pre-History of Metal\" field that listed non-metal musicians that had an influence on heavy metal.
731	It also listed additional bands as examples of the various styles of metal.
732	Some (but not all) of the subgenres were shown over the course of the series.

739	Jeff DanielsJulian SandsHarley Jane KozakJohn GoodmanTrevor JonesMikael SalomonMichael KahnHollywood PicturesAmblin EntertainmentTangled Web ProductionsBuena Vista Pictures110 minutesUnited StatesEnglish$22 million$53.2 millionArachnophobia is a 1990 American black comedy horror film directed by Frank Marshall and starring Jeff Daniels and John Goodman.
740	It was the first film released by The Walt Disney Studios' Hollywood Pictures label, as well as being the directorial debut of Marshall.
741	The film's story centers on a newly discovered Venezuelan spider being transported to a small American town that produces a new species of deadly spiders, which begin killing the town's residents one by one.
742	Shooting took place in Venezuela and California and the film was released in the United States on July 18, 1990.
743	It was a modest commercial success, gaining $53.21 million at the box office and received generally positive reviews from critics.
744	PlotEntomologist Dr. James Atherton searches the Amazon rainforest with the hope of discovering new species of insects and arachnids.
745	In a Venezuelan tepui, Atherton finds a very aggressive new species of spider.
746	The spider is captured and chloroformed for research, and is later revealed to be lacking sex organs, thus making it a drone, or soldier - atypical in spiders.
747	A nature photographer, Jerry Manley, unknowingly has a fertile (non-drone) male spider of the same species jump into his backpack, later that day sneaking into his sleeping bag and biting him.
748	Manley has a massive seizure from the venom and dies.
749	The remainder of the scientists take his body back to the United States, blaming Manley's death on a fever.
750	The spider crawls into the coffin and is sealed in with the corpse.
751	Manley's desiccated body arrives at the funeral home in his hometown of Canaima, California.
752	The spider makes it outside, only to be picked by a crow until the spider bites it and it falls to the ground dead, in front of the barn of the Jennings family.
753	Ross Jennings is a family physician, who had moved to the town from San Francisco.
754	He and his son both have arachnophobia.
755	Ross faces a lack of patients due to elderly rival Sam Metcalf, who was supposed to retire and shift his patients to Ross, but decided to maintain his practice.
756	The Amazonian spider mates with a female domestic house spider and makes a nest in Jennings' barn, producing hundreds of infertile drone offspring, all of which have their father’s lethal bite.
757	Ross' first patient, kindly widower Margaret Hollins, dies after being bitten by one of the new spiders.
758	Metcalf diagnoses a heart attack, although Ross suspects something else was at work.
759	Metcalf suspects Ross is guilty of malpractice, as Ross had taken Margaret off the medication Metcalf had prescribed for her when she was his patient.
760	A spider also kills a high school football player, Todd Miller, just after Ross had performed a routine check on the team, earning him the town nickname \"Dr. Death\".
761	The next victim is Sam Metcalf, who is bitten in his own bedroom and dies in front of his wife.
762	With Metcalf dead, Ross becomes Canaima's town doctor.
763	Knowing Metcalf was bitten by a spider just before his fatal seizure, and that a minute amount of an unknown toxin was detected in his body, Ross suspects deadly arachnids could be infesting the town, and wants to perform autopsies on the recently deceased.
764	Ross and county coroner Milton Briggs perform an autopsy on the victims and confirm Ross' suspicion that the deaths were caused by spider bites.
765	Ross contacts Dr. Atherton and asks him to aid his investigation, given he is the country's leading expert in spiders.
766	Atherton is sceptical that spiders could be the cause of the deaths, and instead of travelling to Cainama himself, he sends one of his assistants, Chris Collins.
767	Chris is initially sceptical, but is convinced there is a deadly strain of spiders in Cainama after the corpses of Margaret Hollins, Todd Miller, and Sam Metcalf all exhibit spider bites.
768	Ross and Chris manage to catch a live specimen of one of the spiders.
769	When Chris mentions the new species of spider Atherton had discovered in Venezuela, Ross realises that one of the Venezuelan spiders \"hitched a ride in Manley's coffin.
770	\"After being contacted by Chris, Atherton arrives in Cainama and joins Ross, Chris, Milt Briggs, local Sheriff Lloyd Parsons and exterminator Delbert McClintock in the spider investigation.
771	They discover the killer spiders have a short life expectancy due to being a mixed breed.
772	Atherton tells them the spiders are soldiers, sent out to eliminate potential threats for lead male spider, \"the General.\"
773	He also learns that the General produced a queen, which it likely mated with to produce a second nest someplace, guarded by the queen, which could produce fertile offspring.
774	Atherton elaborates that the transplanted spiders can progressively expand their territory, possibly culminating in their worldwide dispersal.
775	The group sets out to destroy both nests and kill the Queen and the General.
776	Deducing that one of the nests is in his barn, Ross sends Delbert to destroy it.
777	Delbert finds Atherton dead, having been bitten by the General after disturbing the web.
778	Ross and Chris discover the spiders have killed local mortician Irv Kendall and his wife Blaire (both of whom were killed whilst watching Wheel of Fortune on television).
779	Chris gets the Jennings family out of their infested house, but Ross falls through the floor into his wine cellar, which turns out to be the spiders' second nest, guarded not only by the Queen but also the General.
780	After electrocuting the queen, Ross battles the General while also attempting to burn the second egg sac.
781	Ross becomes trapped underneath fallen debris, with the General about to deliver the killing strike.
782	Ross finally overcomes his paralytic fear of spiders by summoning up his strength to fling the General into the fire.
783	As the egg sac hatches, the General jumps out of the fire.
784	Ross shoots it with a nail gun and the projectile sends the burning spider into the egg sac, destroying the nest with fire.
785	Delbert retrieves Ross from the burning cellar.
786	With the death of the General and the Queen, the egg sac destroyed, and the drones either killed by Delbert or left to die due to their reduced lifespan, the spider plague is over.
787	The Jennings family immediately moves back to San Francisco, appreciating city life once more, despite such minor inconveniences as earthquakes (one of which manages to spill Ross' prized bottle of Château Margaux which he had managed to rescue from his burned cellar).

789	Spielberg and Marshall are both the executive producers of the film.
790	Amblin Entertainment also helped produce it.
791	Marshall meant for the film to be like Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, and added, \"People like to be scared but laughing, like a roller coaster.
792	No one wants to be terrified.\"
793	The film also has similarities with the 1977 film Kingdom of the Spiders.
794	Producer Igo Kantor hinted in his Fangoria interview that Arachnophobia, which Spielberg produced, bears several similarities to Kingdom of the Spiders.
795	\"I thought it was a copy\", Kantor stated, \"but you don't go and sue Spielberg!\"
796	Jamie Hyneman, of MythBusters fame, stated in Popular Mechanics that Arachnophobia was one of the first movies he worked on and that he often relied on simple magnets for several of the effects.
797	The film made use of over 300 Avondale spiders, from New Zealand, which were picked for their large size, unusually social lifestyle, and because they are essentially harmless to humans.
798	They were guided around the set by the use of heat and cold, but the large \"general\" and \"queen\" were articulated models.
799	The movie was actually filmed in Southern Venezuela for the intro sequence and the jungle scenes, as well as Cambria, California.
800	All the school scenes were filmed at Coast Union High School.
801	Students and staff were used in the football scenes and group events.
802	The locker room and players were the actual students and players from CUHS.
803	To create the sound effects of spiders being stepped on or squished, Foley artists stepped on mustard packs or squashed potato chips.
804	Release and receptionArachnophobia was the first film released by Hollywood Pictures.
805	Advertisers were uncertain as to whether they should market the film as a thriller or a comedy.
806	Therefore, television spots promoting the film billed it as a \"thrill-omedy\".
807	Box officeArachnophobia debuted at #3 behind Ghost and Die Hard 2 with $8 million in its first weekend.
808	The film was a financial success, grossing $53,208,180 domestically and going on to gross an additional $30,000,000 in video rentals.
809	This allowed Spielberg to be the fourth wealthiest entertainer of the year, having previously been the second wealthiest.
810	CriticsIn his book, critic Leonard Maltin calls the film a \"slick comic thriller\" and approves of the acting, warning, \"Not recommended for anyone who's ever covered their eyes during a movie.\"
811	Newsweek associated the film with B movies \"about the small town threatened by alien invaders\", and said it was well made but \"oddly unresonant.\"
812	Roger Ebert said the film made audiences \"squirm out of enjoyment, not terror\", giving it three stars out of four.
813	On the review website Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 36 reviews, and an average rating of 6.8/10.
814	The website's critical consensus reads, \"Arachnophobia may not deliver genuine chills, but it's an affectionate, solidly built tribute to Hollywood's classic creature features.
815	\"The film drew protests from some people interested in spiders, as they believed the film tarnished the public image of spiders.

827	The European version of the album has the same cover art, but more score tracks, fewer songs and no dialogue.
828	The two versions share 10 of the same tracks, but these are also not without their differences: several tracks are noticeably shorter on the European version like \"Canaima Nightmare\", which is nearly three minutes shorter; and another track has two different titles (\"Cellar Theme\" in America and \"The Cellar\" in Europe).

836	And Then There Were None]Murder Is EasySad Cypress
837	And Then There Were None is a mystery novel by English writer Agatha Christie, her best selling novel and described by her as the most difficult of her books to write.
838	It was first published in the United Kingdom by the Collins Crime Club on 6 November 1939, as Ten Little Niggers, after the British blackface song, which serves as a major plot point.
839	The US edition was released in January 1940 with the title
840	And Then There Were None, which is taken from the last five words of the song.
841	 All successive American reprints and adaptations use that title, except for the Pocket Books paperbacks published between 1964 and 1986, which appeared under the title Ten Little Indians.
842	The book is the world's best-selling mystery, and with over 100 million copies sold is one of the best-selling books of all time.
843	Publications International lists the novel as the sixth best-selling title.
844	Plot summary
845	On a hot 8 August in the late 1930s, eight people arrive on a small, isolated island off the Devon coast of England.
846	Each has an invitation tailored to his or her personal circumstances, such as an offer of employment or an unexpected late summer holiday.
847	They are met by Thomas and Ethel Rogers, the butler and cook-housekeeper, who state that their hosts, Mr Ulick Norman Owen and his wife Mrs Una Nancy Owen, whom they have not yet met in person, have not arrived, but left instructions, which strikes all the guests as odd.
848	A framed copy of a nursery rhyme, \"Ten Little Niggers\" (called \"Ten Little Indians\" or \"Ten Little Soldiers\" in later editions), hangs in every guest's room, and ten figurines sit on the dining room table.
849	After supper, a gramophone (or \"phonograph\") record is played;  the recording describes each visitor in turn, accuses each of having committed murder but escaping justice, and then asks if any of \"the accused\" wishes to offer a defence.
850	All but Anthony Marston and Philip Lombard deny the charges, and Miss Brent refuses to discuss the matter.
851	They discover that none of them actually knows the Owens, and Justice Wargrave concludes that the name \"U.N. Owen\" is shorthand for \"Unknown\".
852	After the recording, Marston finishes his drink and immediately dies from cyanide poisoning.
853	The remaining guests notice that one of the ten figurines is now broken, and the nursery rhyme appears to reflect the manner of death (\"One choked his little self and then there were nine\").
854	The next morning, Mrs Rogers' corpse is found in her bed; she had died in her sleep from an overdose of chloral hydrate.
855	By lunchtime, General MacArthur is found dead, from a heavy blow to his head.
856	Two more figurines are found to be broken, and again the deaths parallel the rhyme.
857	Miss Brent relates the account of the gramophone charge against her to Vera Claythorne, who later tells the others.
858	A search for Mr Owen shows that nobody else is on the island except the remaining seven.
859	The island is a \"bare rock\" with no hiding places, and no one could have arrived or left; thus, they conclude that any one of the seven remaining persons is the killer.
860	Wargrave leads the group in determining that so far, none of them can definitively be ruled out as the murderer.
861	The next morning, Rogers is found dead while chopping wood, and after breakfast, Miss Brent is found dead in the kitchen, where she had been left alone after complaining of feeling unwell; she had been injected with potassium cyanide via a hypodermic needle.
862	Wargrave then suggests searching all the rooms, and any potentially dangerous items they can think of are locked up.
863	Lombard's gun is missing from his room.
864	When Vera goes upstairs to take a bath, she is shocked by the touch and smell of seaweed left hanging from the ceiling of her room and screams; the remaining guests rush upstairs to her room.
865	Wargrave, however, is still downstairs.
866	The others find him seated, immobile and crudely dressed up in the attire of a judge.
867	Wargrave is examined briefly by Dr Armstrong and pronounced dead from a gunshot to the forehead.
868	That night, Lombard appears surprised when he finds his gun returned to his room.
869	Blore catches a glimpse of someone leaving the house but loses the trail.
870	He then discovers Armstrong is absent from his room, and the remaining three guests conclude that Armstrong must be the killer.
871	Vera, Blore, and Lombard decide to stay together at all times.
872	In the morning, they signal ]] to the mainland from outside by using a [[Mirror#Signalling|mirror and sunlight, but receive no reply.
873	Blore then returns to the house for food by himself and is killed by a heavy bear-shaped clock statue that is pushed from Vera's window sill, crushing his skull.
874	Vera and Lombard are now confident that Armstrong is the killer.
875	However, shortly afterwards, the duo come upon Armstrong's body washed up on the beach.
876	They realize that Armstrong could not have killed Blore.
877	Panicked, each concludes the other must be the killer.
878	Quickly regaining her composure, Vera suggests moving the doctor's body past the shore, but this is a pretext.
879	She lifts Lombard's gun.
880	When Lombard lunges at her to get it back, she shoots him dead.
881	She returns to the house in a shaken dreamlike state, relieved to be alive.
882	She finds a noose and chair arranged in her room, and a strong smell of the sea.
883	With visions of her former lover Hugo urging her on, she adjusts the noose and kicks the chair out from under her.
884	Two Scotland Yard officials are puzzled by the identity of U N Owen.
885	Although they can partially reconstruct the deaths from Marston to Wargrave with the help of the victims' diaries and a coroner's careful report, they conclude that U N  Owen was one of the victims, but are unable to determine which one; they also think that none of the last four victims (Armstrong, Blore, Lombard, or Claythorne) can be U N Owen at all; for example The chair on which Vera stood to hang herself had been set back upright, indicating that someone was still alive on the island after her suicide, presumably the killer.
886	Postscript from the Killer
887	In a postscript, a fishing ship picks up a bottle inside its trawling nets; the bottle contains a written confession of the killings, which is then sent to Scotland Yard.
888	It is not known how long after the killings the bottle was discovered.
889	In the confession, Justice Wargrave writes that he has long wished to set an unsolvable puzzle of murder.
890	His victims would be of his choosing, as they were not found guilty in a trial.
891	He explains how he tricked Dr Armstrong, who trusted the judge, into helping him fake his own death under the pretext that it would help the group identify the killer.
892	He explains that he replaced the chair in Vera's room.
893	Finally, he reveals how he used the gun and some elastic to ensure his own death matched the account in the guests' diaries.
894	Although he wished to create an unsolvable mystery, he acknowledges in the missive a \"pitiful human need\" for recognition, hence the confession.
895	He describes how his first victim was Isaac Morris, the sleazy lawyer and drug trafficker who anonymously purchased the island and arranged the invitations on his behalf, making nine murders and two suicides.
896	Morris was poisoned before Wargrave departed for the island.
897	Wargrave's intention is to stymie the police as to which person on the island was the murderer.
898	He states that, although there are three clues that could guide the police to the correct killer, he is confident the mystery will remain unsolved until the confession is read.
899	CharactersThe following details of the characters are based on the original novel published in England.
900	Anthony James Marston, an amoral and irresponsible young man, killed two young children (John and Lucy Combes) while driving recklessly, for which he felt no real remorse and accepted no personal responsibility, complaining only that his driving licence had been suspended as a result.
901	He was the first island victim.
902	Mrs Ethel Rogers, the cook/housekeeper and Thomas Rogers' wife, described as a pale and ghost-like woman who walks in mortal fear.
903	She was dominated by her bullying husband, who coerced her into agreeing to withhold the medicine of a former employer (Miss Jennifer Brady, an elderly spinster) in order that they might collect an inheritance they knew she had left them in her will.
904	Mrs Rogers was the second victim.
905	General John Gordon MacArthur, a retired World War I war hero, who sent his late wife's lover (a younger officer, Arthur Richmond) to his death by assigning him to a mission where it was practically guaranteed he would not survive.
906	Leslie MacArthur had mistakenly put the wrong letters in the envelopes on one occasion when she wrote to both men at the same time.
907	The general tells Vera that no one will leave the island alive.
908	Thomas Rogers, the butler and Ethel Rogers' husband.
909	He dominated his weak-willed wife, and they killed their former elderly employer by withholding her medicine, causing the woman to die from heart failure, thus inheriting the money she bequeathed them in her will.
910	Despite his wife's death, Rogers was still serving the others.
911	Emily Caroline Brent, an elderly, religiously rigid, socially respectable spinster who accepted the vacation on Soldier Island largely due to financial constraints.
912	Years earlier, she had dismissed her teenage maid, Beatrice Taylor, for becoming pregnant out of wedlock.
913	Beatrice, who had already been rejected by her parents for the same reason, drowned herself, which Miss Brent considered an even worse sin.
914	The murderer put a bee into the room, in addition to murder by poison.
915	(\"A bumblebee stung one...\")
916	Dr Edward George Armstrong, a Harley Street doctor, responsible for the death of a patient, Louisa Mary Clees, after he operated on her while drunk many years earlier.
917	William Henry Blore, a former police inspector and now a private investigator, was accused of falsifying his testimony in court for a bribe from a dangerous criminal gang, which resulted in an innocent man, James Landor, being convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.
918	Landor, who had a wife and young child, died shortly afterwards in prison.
919	Blore arrived under the alias \"Davis\" from South Africa, on the island for \"security work.\"
920	His true name is revealed on the gramophone recording.
921	He denies the accusation against him from the gramophone recording, but later admits the truth to Lombard.
922	Philip Lombard, a soldier of fortune.
923	Literally down to his last square meal when he met Isaac Morris who made the proposition which brought Lombard to the island, he carries a loaded revolver, as Morris had hinted he might wish to do.
924	Lombard is accused of causing the deaths of a number of East African tribesmen, after stealing their food and abandoning them to their deaths.
925	Neither he nor Marston feels any remorse.
926	He is the only one to theorize that U N Owen might be Wargrave, but the others reject this.
927	He and Vera are the only victims not killed by Justice Wargrave.
928	Vera Elizabeth Claythorne, a cool, efficient, resourceful young woman who is on leave from her position as a sports mistress at a third-rate girls' school.
929	Her job as a governess was ended by the death of her charge, Cyril Hamilton.
930	Claythorne let the boy drown so his uncle Hugo Hamilton could inherit the family estate and marry her.
931	Hugo rejected her when he somehow realized what she had done.
932	Justice Lawrence John Wargrave, a retired judge, known as a \"hanging judge\" for liberally awarding the death penalty in murder cases.
933	Wargrave is accused of influencing the jury to hand a guilty verdict to Edward Seton, a man many thought was innocent of his crime of killing an old woman, and sentencing him to death unfairly.
934	As the two policemen discuss at Scotland Yard, new evidence after Seton's execution proved Seton's guilt.
935	Wargrave admits in his postscript that he has a lifelong hidden sadistic urge to kill, but only the guilty.
936	Finding himself terminally ill, he devises and carries out this plot.
937	Isaac Morris is a sleazy and unethical lawyer hired by Wargrave to purchase the island (under the name U N Owen), arrange the gramophone recording, and make arrangements on his behalf, including gathering information on the near destitute Philip Lombard, to whom he gave some money to get by and recommended Lombard bring his gun to the island.
938	Morris's is the first death chronologically, as he died before the guests arrived on the island.
939	Morris was responsible for the addiction and suicide of a young woman through his narcotics activities.
940	The victim was the daughter of a friend of Wargrave.
941	A hypochondriac, Morris accepted a lethal cocktail of pills from Wargrave to help treat his largely self-imagined physical ailments.
942	Fred Narracott, the boatman who delivered the guests to the island.
943	After doing so, he does not appear again in the story, although Inspector Maine notes it was Narracott who, sensing something seriously amiss, returned to the island as soon as the weather allowed, before he was scheduled to do so, and found the bodies.
944	Maine speculates that it was the normalcy and ordinariness of the guests that convinced Narracott to do so and ignore his orders to dismiss any signals requesting help.
945	Sir Thomas Legge and Inspector Maine, two Scotland Yard detectives who discuss the case in the epilogue.
946	They reason out the events of the case, but are stymied as to which was the murderer until the confession comes to light.
947	Literary significance and reception
948	Writing for The Times Literary Supplement of 11 November 1939, Maurice Percy Ashley stated, \"If her latest story has scarcely any detection in it there is no scarcity of murders...
949	There is a certain feeling of monotony inescapable in the regularity of the deaths which is better suited to a serialized newspaper story than a full-length novel.
950	Yet there is an ingenious problem to solve in naming the murderer\", he continued.
951	\"It will be an extremely astute reader who guesses correctly.
952	\"For The New York Times Book Review (25 February 1940), Isaac Anderson has arrived to the point where \"the voice\" accuses the ten \"guests\" of their past crimes, which have all resulted in the deaths of humans, and then said, \"When you read what happens after that you will not believe it, but you will keep on reading, and as one incredible event is followed by another even more incredible you will still keep on reading.
953	The whole thing is utterly impossible and utterly fascinating.
954	It is the most baffling mystery that Agatha Christie has ever written, and if any other writer has ever surpassed it for sheer puzzlement the name escapes our memory.
955	We are referring, of course, to mysteries that have logical explanations, as this one has.
956	It is a tall story, to be sure, but it could have happened.
957	\"Many compared the book to her novel The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (1926).
958	For instance, an unnamed reviewer in the Toronto Daily Star of 16 March 1940 said, \"Others have written better mysteries than Agatha Christie, but no one can touch her for ingenious plot and surprise ending.
959	With And Then There Were None... she is at her most ingenious and most surprising... is, indeed, considerably above the standard of her last few works and close to the Roger Ackroyd level.\"
960	Other critics laud the use of plot twists and surprise endings.
961	Maurice Richardson wrote a rhapsodic review in The Observer's issue of 5 November 1939 which began, \"No wonder Agatha Christie's latest has sent her publishers into a vatic  trance.
962	We will refrain, however, from any invidious comparisons with Roger Ackroyd and be content with saying that Ten Little Niggers is one of the very best, most genuinely bewildering Christies yet written.
963	We will also have to refrain from reviewing it thoroughly, as it is so full of shocks that even the mildest revelation would spoil some surprise from somebody, and I am sure that you would rather have your entertainment kept fresh than criticism pure.\"
964	After stating the set-up of the plot, Richardson concluded, \"Story telling and characterisation are right at the top of Mrs Christie's baleful form.
965	Her plot may be highly artificial, but it is neat, brilliantly cunning, soundly constructed, and free from any of those red-herring false trails which sometimes disfigure her work.
966	\"Robert Barnard, a recent critic, concurred with the reviews, describing the book as \"Suspenseful and menacing detective-story-cum-thriller.
967	The closed setting with the succession of deaths is here taken to its logical conclusion, and the dangers of ludicrousness and sheer reader-disbelief are skillfully avoided.
968	Probably the best-known Christie, and justifiably among the most popular.
969	\"The original title of the mystery (Ten Little Niggers) was changed because it was offensive in the United States and some other places.
970	 Alison Light, a literary critic and feminist scholar, opined that Christie's original title and the setting on \"Nigger Island\" (later changed to \"Indian Island\" and \"Soldier Island\", variously) were integral to the work.
971	These aspects of the novel, she argued, \"could be relied upon automatically to conjure up a thrilling 'otherness', a place where revelations about the 'dark side' of the English would be appropriate.\"
972	Unlike novels such as Heart of Darkness, \"Christie's location is both more domesticated and privatized, taking for granted the construction of racial fears woven into psychic life as early as the nursery.
973	If her story suggests how easy it is to play upon such fears, it is also a reminder of how intimately tied they are to sources of pleasure and enjoyment.
974	\"In the \"Binge!\" article of Entertainment Weekly Issue
975	#1343-44 (26 December 2014–3 January 2015), the writers picked
976	And Then There Were None as an \"EW favorite\" on the list of the \"Nine Great Christie Novels\".

1005	The titleCover of first US 1940 edition with current title for all English-language versions.
1006	The novel was originally published in late 1939 and early 1940 almost simultaneously, in the United Kingdom and the United States.
1007	In the UK it appeared under the title Ten Little Niggers, in book and newspaper serialized formats.
1008	The serialization was in 23 parts in the Daily Express from Tuesday 6 June to Saturday 1 July 1939.
1009	All of the instalments carried an illustration by \"Prescott\" with the first having an illustration of Burgh Island in Devon which inspired the setting of the story.
1010	The serialized version did not contain any chapter divisions.
1011	The book retailed for seven shillings and six pence.
1012	In the United States it was published under the title
1013	And Then There Were None, again in both book and serial formats.
1014	Both of the original US publications changed the title from that originally used in the UK, due to the offensiveness of the word in American culture, where it was more widely perceived as a racially loaded ethnic slur or insult compared to the contemporaneous culture in the United Kingdom.
1015	The serialized version appeared in the Saturday Evening Post in seven parts from 20 May (Volume 211, Number 47) to 1 July 1939 (Volume 212, Number 1) with illustrations by Henry Raleigh, and the book was published in January 1940 by Dodd, Mead and Company for $2.
1016	In the original UK novel all references to \"Indians\" or \"Soldiers\" were originally \"Nigger\", including the island's name, the pivotal rhyme found by the visitors, and the ten figurines.
1017	(In Chapter 7, Vera Claythorne becomes semi-hysterical at the mention by Miss Brent of \"our black brothers\", which is understandable only in the context of the original name).
1018	UK editions changed to the current definitive title in 1985.
1019	The word \"nigger\" was already racially offensive in the United States by the start of the 20th century, and therefore the book's first US edition and first serialization changed the title to
1020	And Then There Were None and removed all references to the word from the book, as did the 1945 motion picture.
1021	Sensitivity to the original title of the novel was remarked by Sadie Stein in 2016, commenting on a BBC mini series with the title
1022	And Then There Were None, where she noted that the original title of the novel \"Even in 1939, this title was considered too offensive for American publication.\"
1023	In general, \"Christie’s work is not known for its racial sensitivity, and by modern standards her oeuvre is rife with casual Orientalism.\"
1024	The original title was based on a rhyme from minstrel shows and children's games, \"a rhyme so macabre and distressing one doesn’t hear it now outside of the Agatha Christie context.\"
1025	Stein quotes Alison Light as to the power of the original name of the island in the novel, Nigger Island, \"to conjure up a thrilling ‘otherness’, a place where revelations about the ‘dark side’ of the English would be appropriate\".
1026	Speaking of the \"widely known\" 1945 movie, Stein added that \"we’re merely faced with fantastic amounts of violence, and a rhyme so macabre and distressing one doesn’t hear it now outside of the Agatha Christie context.\"
1027	She felt that the original title of the novel in the UK, seen now, \"that original title, it jars, viscerally.\"Publication historyThis is the best selling crime novel of all time, and what makes Agatha Christie the best selling novelist.
1028	It is Christie's best-selling novel, with more than 100 million copies sold; it is also the world's best-selling mystery and one of the best-selling books of all time.
1029	Publications International lists the novel as the sixth best-selling title.
1030	The book and its adaptations have been released under various new names since the original publication, including Ten Little Indians (1946 play, Broadway performance and 1964 paperback book), Ten Little Soldiers and official title per the Agatha Christie Limited website, And Then There Were None.
1031	UK editions continued to use the work's original title until the 1980s; the first UK edition to use the alternative title And Then There Were None appeared in 1985 with a reprint of the 1963 Fontana Paperback.

1058	 (Late use of the original title in an Australian edition.)
1059	 (Last publication of novel under the title Ten Little Indians.)
1060	Foreign language editionsThe sensitivity of the original British title varies across nations, depending on their culture and which words are used to describe people by skin colour.
1061	In the US, the British title was considered offensive at first publication, and changed to the last line of the rhyme instead of its title.
1062	As the estate of Agatha Christie now offers it under one title only in English, And Then There Were None, it is likely that new foreign language editions will match that title in their language.
1063	The original title (Ten Little Niggers) still survives in a few foreign-language versions of the novel, such as the Bulgarian title Десет малки негърчета, and was used in other languages for a time, for example in Dutch until the 1994 release of the 18th edition.
1064	The title Ten Little Negroes continues to be commonly used in foreign-language versions, for example in Spanish, Greek, Serbian, Romanian, French and Hungarian, as well as a 1987 Russian film adaptation Десять негритят (Desyat Negrityat).
1065	In 1999, the Slovak National Theatre staged the play under its original title but changed to A napokon nezostal už nik (And Then There Were None) mid-run.
1066	Possible inspirationsThe 1930 novel The Invisible Host by Gwen Bristow and Bruce Manning has a plot that strongly matches that of Christie's later novel, including a recorded voice announcing to the guests that their sins will be visited upon them by death.
1067	 The Invisible Host was adapted as the 1930 Broadway The Ninth Guest by Owen Davis, which itself was adapted as the 1934 film The Ninth Guest.
1068	There is no evidence Christie saw either the play (which had a brief run on Broadway) or the film.
1069	The 1933 K.B.S. Productions Sherlock Holmes film A Study in Scarlet follows a strikingly similar plot; it includes a scene where Holmes is shown a card with the hint: \"Six little Indians ....bee stung one and then there were five\".
1070	In this case, the rhyme refers to \"Ten Little Fat Boys\".
1071	(The film's plot bears no resemblance to Arthur Conan Doyle's original story of the same name.)
1072	The author of the movie's screenplay, Robert Florey, \"doubted that [Christie] had seen A Study in Scarlet, but he regarded it as a compliment if it had helped inspire her\".
1073	Adaptations
1074	And Then There Were None has had more adaptations than any other single work by Agatha Christie.
1075	It is the isolated location where all the players on scene are murdered, never knowing who their murderer is, that is the idea.
1076	\"It was an idea which is now the basis for many Hollywood horror films and has become a cliché to modern audiences, but it was Agatha Christie who was the first to do it and so successfully that the story has become her most adapted piece.\"
1077	She changed the bleak ending to a more palatable one for theatre audiences when she adapted the novel for the stage in 1943.
1078	Many adaptations incorporate changes to the story, such as using Christie's alternative ending from her stage play or changing the setting to locations other than an island.
1079	With a plot line so well known, parodies and references to the novel or the play are frequent.
1080	Many television programs use the essence of the plot, a group of characters cut off from the outside world with a murderer in their midst, (sometimes with innocent victims in place of guilty victims), and give no credit to Agatha Christie for the many similarities in plot and motivation.
1081	FilmThere have been numerous film adaptations of the novel, some comedic.
1082	Examples include:
1083	And Then There Were None (1945 film), René Clair's cinema adaptation was a successful US productionTen Little Indians (1965 film) is George Pollock's cinema adaptationGumnaam (1965, translation:
1084	Unknown or Anonymous) is an Indian suspense thriller film adaptation.
1085	Five Dolls for an August Moon (1970) is a loose Italian giallo adaptation directed by Mario Bava.
1086	Nadu Iravil (1970, translation: In the middle of the night), a Tamil adaptation directed by Sundaram Balachander
1087	And Then There Were None (1974 film), the first English-language colour version, directed by Peter CollinsonDesyat' Negrityat (1987, Десять негритят, Eng: \"Ten Little Negroes\") Stanislav Govorukhin's Russian adaptation keeps intact Christie's grim storyline and ending.
1088	Ten Little Indians, a 1989 American version directed by Alan BirkinshawAduthathu (2012) is a Tamil adaptationAatagara (2015) is a Kannada film adaptationRadioThe BBC broadcast Ten Little Niggers (1947), adapted by Ayton Whitaker, first aired as a Monday Matinee on the BBC Home Service on 27 December 1947 and as Saturday Night Theatre on the BBC Light Programme on 29 December.
1089	On 13 November 2010, as part of its Saturday Play series, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 90-minute adaptation written by Joy Wilkinson.
1090	The production was directed by Mary Peate and featured, among others, Geoffrey Whitehead as Justice Wargrave, Lyndsey Marshal as Vera Claythorne, Alex Wyndham as Philip Lombard, John Rowe as Dr. Armstrong, and Joanna Monro as Emily Brent.
1091	In this production, which is extremely faithful to the novel, the rhyme is \"Ten Little Soldier Boys\".
1092	Stage
1093	And Then There Were None (1943 play) is Christie's adaptation of the story for the stage.
1094	She and the producers agreed that audiences might not flock to a tale with such a grim ending as the novel, nor would it work well dramatically as there would be no one left to tell the story.
1095	Thus, she reworked the ending for Lombard and Vera to be innocent of the crimes of which they were accused, survive, and fall in love with each other.
1096	Some of the names were also changed, e.g., General Macarthur became General McKenzie in both the New York and London productions.
1097	By 1943, General Douglas MacArthur was playing a prominent role in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, which may explain the change of the character's name.
1098	Regardless of the reason, it was changed.
1099	Ten little niggers (1944 play), Dundee Repertory Theatre Company was given special permission to restore the original ending of the novel.
1100	The company first performed a stage adaptation of the novel in August 1944 under the UK title of the novel, with Agatha Christie credited as the dramatist.
1101	It was the first performance in repertory theatre.
1102	It was staged again in 1965.
1103	There was an article in the Dundee Evening Register in August 1944 
1104	And Then There Were None (2005 play), On 14 October 2005, a new version of the play, written by Kevin Elyot and directed by Steven Pimlott, opened at the Gielgud Theatre in London.
1105	For this version, Elyot returned to the original story in the novel, restoring the nihilism of the original.
1106	TelevisionSeveral variations of the original novel were adapted for television, three of which were British adaptations.
1107	The first of these, in 1949, was produced by the BBC.
1108	The second was produced in 1959, by ITV.
1109	 Both of those productions aired with Christie's original title.
1110	The third and most recent British adaptation aired as
1111	And Then There Were None on BBC One in December 2015, as a mini-series produced in cooperation with Acorn Media and Agatha Christie Productions.
1112	 The 2015 production adhered more closely to the original plot, though there were several differences, and was the first English language film adaptation to feature an ending similar to that of the novel.
1113	On 25 and 26 March 2017 TV Asahi in Japan aired そして誰もいなくなった (Soshite daremo inakunatta), a Japanese language adaptation by Nagasaka Shukei (長坂秀佳) of the original story set in modern times.
1114	Other media
1115	The novel has been the inspiration for several video games.
1116	 For the Apple II, Online Systems released the game Mystery House in 1980.
1117	 On the PC, The Adventure Company released the video game Agatha Christie:
1118	And Then There Were None in 2005, the first in a series of PC games based on Christie novels.
1119	In February 2008, it was ported to the Wii console.
1120	The identity of the murderer is not that of the killer in the original book.
1121	The game player assumes the role of Patrick Naracott (brother of Fred Naracott, who is involved in a newly created subplot), who is stranded with the others when his boat is scuttled.
1122	This allows for alternate, more successful endings in which Naracott survives and is able to prevent the murders of the innocent Lombard and Claythorne.
1123	All endings depart markedly from the novel and previous adaptations in that the killer and motives are different.
1124	And Then There Were None was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 30 April 2009, adapted by François Rivière and illustrated by Frank Leclercq.
1125	Peká Editorial released a board game based on the book, created by Judit Hurtado and Fernando Chavarría, and illustrated by Esperanza Peinado.
