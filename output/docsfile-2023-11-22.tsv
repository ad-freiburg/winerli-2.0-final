8	It was founded in 1871 when the south German states, except for Austria, joined the North German Confederation.
9	On 1 January 1871, the new constitution came into force that changed the name of the federal state and introduced the title of emperor for Wilhelm I, King of Prussia from the House of Hohenzollern.
10	Berlin remained its capital, and Otto von Bismarck remained Chancellor, the head of government.
11	As these events occurred, the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War.
12	The German Empire consisted of 26 states, most of them ruled by royal families.
13	They included four kingdoms, six grand duchies, five duchies (six before 1876), seven principalities, three free Hanseatic cities, and one imperial territory.
14	Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm, it contained about two thirds of Germany's population and territory.
15	Prussian dominance was also established constitutionally.
16	After 1850, the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized, with particular strengths in coal, iron (and later steel), chemicals, and railways.
17	In 1871, Germany had a population of 41 million people; by 1913, this had increased to 68 million.
18	A heavily rural collection of states in 1815, the now united Germany became predominantly urban.
19	During its 47 years of existence, the German Empire was an industrial, technological, and scientific giant, gaining more Nobel Prizes in science than any other country.
20	By 1900, Germany was the largest economy in Europe, surpassing the United Kingdom, as well as the second-largest in the world, behind only the United States.
21	From 1867 to 1878/9, Otto von Bismarck's tenure as the first and to this day longest reigning Chancellor was marked by relative liberalism, but it became more conservative afterwards.
22	Broad reforms and the Kulturkampf marked his period in the office.
23	Late in Bismarck's chancellorship and in spite of his personal opposition, Germany became involved in colonialism.
24	Claiming much of the leftover territory that was yet unclaimed in the Scramble for Africa, it managed to build the third-largest colonial empire after the British and the French ones.
25	As a colonial state, it sometimes clashed with other European powers, especially the British Empire.
26	Germany became a great power, boasting a rapidly developing rail network, the world's strongest army, and a fast-growing industrial base.
27	In less than a decade, its navy became second only to Britain's Royal Navy.
28	After the removal of Otto von Bismarck by Wilhelm II in 1890, the Empire embarked on Weltpolitik – a bellicose new course that ultimately contributed to the outbreak of World War I.
29	In addition, Bismarck's successors were incapable of maintaining their predecessor's complex, shifting, and overlapping alliances which had kept Germany from being diplomatically isolated.
30	This period was marked by various factors influencing the Emperor's decisions, which were often perceived as contradictory or unpredictable by the public.
31	In 1879, the German Empire consolidated the Dual Alliance with Austria-Hungary, followed by the Triple Alliance with Italy in 1882.
32	It also retained strong diplomatic ties to the Ottoman Empire.
33	When the great crisis of 1914 arrived, Italy left the alliance and the Ottoman Empire formally allied with Germany.
34	In the First World War, German plans to capture Paris quickly in the autumn of 1914 failed.
35	 The war on the Western Front became a stalemate.
36	The Allied naval blockade caused severe shortages of food.
37	However, Imperial Germany had  success on the Eastern Front; it occupied a large amount of territory to its east following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.
38	The German declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare in early 1917, contributed to bringing the United States into the war.
39	The high command under Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff increasingly controlled the country, but in October after the failed offensive in spring 1918, the German armies were in retreat, allies Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire had collapsed, and Bulgaria had surrendered.
40	The Empire collapsed in the November 1918 Revolution with the abdications of its monarchs.
41	This left a postwar federal republic and a devastated and unsatisfied populace, which later led to the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazism.
42	HistoryBackgroundOtto von Bismarck, the visionary statesman who unified Germany with the help of his skillful political moves and the exploitation of encountered opportunities The German Confederation had been created by an act of the Congress of Vienna on 8 June 1815 as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, after being alluded to in Article 6  of the 1814 Treaty of Paris.
43	German nationalism rapidly shifted from its liberal and democratic character in 1848, called Pan-Germanism, to Prussian prime minister Otto von Bismarck's pragmatic Realpolitik.
44	Bismarck sought to extend Hohenzollern hegemony throughout the German states; to do so meant unification of the German states and the exclusion of Prussia's main German rival, Austria, from the subsequent German Empire.
45	He envisioned a conservative, Prussian-dominated Germany.
46	Three wars led to military successes and helped to persuade German people to do this: the Second Schleswig War against Denmark in 1864, the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, and the Franco-Prussian War against France in 1870–71.
47	The German Confederation ended as a result of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 between the constituent Confederation entities of the Austrian Empire and its allies on one side and the Kingdom of Prussia and its allies on the other.
48	The war resulted in the partial replacement of the Confederation in 1867 by a North German Confederation, comprising the 22 states north of the Main.
49	The patriotic fervour generated by the Franco-Prussian War overwhelmed the remaining opposition to a unified Germany (aside from Austria) in the four states south of the Main and during November 1870 they joined the North German Confederation by treaty.
50	FoundationOn 10 December 1870, the North German Confederation Reichstag renamed the Confederation the \\"German Empire\\" and gave the title of German Emperor to William I, the King of Prussia, as Bundespräsidium of the Confederation.
51	The new constitution (Constitution of the German Confederation) and the title Emperor came into effect on 1 January 1871.
52	During the Siege of Paris on 18 January 1871, William accepted to be proclaimed Emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles.
53	The second German Constitution, adopted by the Reichstag on 14 April 1871 and proclaimed by the Emperor on 16 April, was substantially based upon Bismarck's North German Constitution.
54	The political system remained the same.
55	The empire had a parliament called the Reichstag, which was elected by universal male suffrage.
56	However, the original constituencies drawn in 1871 were never redrawn to reflect the growth of urban areas.
57	As a result, by the time of the great expansion of German cities in the 1890s and 1900s, rural areas were grossly over-represented.

60	At centre (in white): Otto von Bismarck, first Chancellor of Germany, Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, Prussian Chief of Staff.
61	Legislation also required the consent of the Bundesrat, the federal council of deputies from the 27 states.
62	Executive power was vested in the emperor, or Kaiser, who was assisted by a chancellor responsible only to him.
63	The emperor was given extensive powers by the constitution.
64	He alone appointed and dismissed the chancellor (so in practice the emperor ruled the empire through the chancellor), was supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and final arbiter of all foreign affairs, and could also disband the Reichstag to call for new elections.
65	Officially, the chancellor was a one-man cabinet and was responsible for the conduct of all state affairs; in practice, the State Secretaries (bureaucratic top officials in charge of such fields as finance, war, foreign affairs, etc.) acted as unofficial portfolio ministers.
66	The Reichstag had the power to pass, amend, or reject bills and to initiate legislation.
67	However, as mentioned above, in practice the real power was vested in the emperor, who exercised it through his chancellor.
68	Although nominally a federal empire and league of equals, in practice, the empire was dominated by the largest and most powerful state, Prussia.
69	Prussia stretched across the northern two-thirds of the new Reich and contained three-fifths of its population.
70	The imperial crown was hereditary in the ruling house of Prussia, the House of Hohenzollern.
71	With the exception of 1872–1873 and 1892–1894, the chancellor was always simultaneously the prime minister of Prussia.
72	With 17 out of 58 votes in the Bundesrat, Berlin needed only a few votes from the smaller states to exercise effective control.
73	The other states retained their own governments, but had only limited aspects of sovereignty.
74	For example, both postage stamps and currency were issued for the empire as a whole.
75	Coins through one mark were also minted in the name of the empire, while higher-valued pieces were issued by the states.
76	However, these larger gold and silver issues were virtually commemorative coins and had limited circulation.
77	While the states issued their own decorations and some had their own armies, the military forces of the smaller ones were put under Prussian control.
78	Those of the larger states, such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Saxony, were coordinated along Prussian principles and would in wartime be controlled by the federal government.
79	The evolution of the German Empire is somewhat in line with parallel developments in Italy, which became a united nation-state a decade earlier.
80	Some key elements of the German Empire's authoritarian political structure were also the basis for conservative modernization in Imperial Japan under Meiji and the preservation of an authoritarian political structure under the tsars in the Russian Empire.
81	One factor in the social anatomy of these governments was the retention of a very substantial share in political power by the landed elite, the Junkers, resulting from the absence of a revolutionary breakthrough by the peasants in combination with urban areas.
82	Although authoritarian in many respects, the empire had some democratic features.
83	Besides universal suffrage, it permitted the development of political parties.
84	Bismarck's intention was to create a constitutional façade which would mask the continuation of authoritarian policies.
85	In the process, he created a system with a serious flaw.
86	There was a significant disparity between the Prussian and German electoral systems.
87	Prussia used a highly restrictive three-class voting system in which the richest third of the population could choose 85% of the legislature, all but assuring a conservative majority.
88	As mentioned above, the king and (with two exceptions) the prime minister of Prussia were also the emperor and chancellor of the empire – meaning that the same rulers had to seek majorities from legislatures elected from completely different franchises.
89	Universal suffrage was significantly diluted by gross over-representation of rural areas from the 1890s onward.
90	By the turn of the century, the urban-rural population balance was completely reversed from 1871; more than two-thirds of the empire's people lived in cities and towns.
91	Bismarck eraOtto von Bismarck Bismarck's domestic policies played an important role in forging the authoritarian political culture of the Kaiserreich.
92	Less preoccupied by continental power politics following unification in 1871, Germany's semi-parliamentary government carried out a relatively smooth economic and political revolution from above that pushed them along the way towards becoming the world's leading industrial power of the time.
93	Bismarck's \\"revolutionary conservatism\\" was a conservative state-building strategy designed to make ordinary Germans—not just the Junker elite—more loyal to throne and empire.
94	According to Kees van Kersbergen and Barbara Vis, his strategy was:granting social rights to enhance the integration of a hierarchical society, to forge a bond between workers and the state so as to strengthen the latter, to maintain traditional relations of authority between social and status groups, and to provide a countervailing power against the modernist forces of liberalism and socialism.
95	He created the modern welfare state in Germany in the 1880s and enacted universal male suffrage in the new German Empire in 1871.
96	He became a great hero to German conservatives, who erected many monuments to his memory and tried to emulate his policies.
97	Foreign policyBismarck's post-1871 foreign policy was conservative and sought to preserve the balance of power in Europe.
98	British historian Eric Hobsbawm concludes that he \\"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [devoting] himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers\\".
99	This was a departure from his adventurous foreign policy for Prussia, where he favored strength and expansion, punctuating this by saying \\"The great question of the age are not settled by speeches and majority votes - this was the error of 1848-49 - but by iron and blood.\\"
100	Bismarck's chief concern was that France would plot revenge after its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War.
101	As the French lacked the strength to defeat Germany by themselves, they sought an alliance with Russia, which would trap Germany between the two in a war (as would ultimately happen in 1914).
102	Bismarck wanted to prevent this at all costs and maintain friendly relations with the Russians, and thereby formed an alliance with them and Austria-Hungary, the Dreikaiserbund (League of Three Emperors) in 1881.
103	The alliance was further cemented by a separate non-aggression pact with Russia called Reinsurance Treaty, which was signed in 1887.
104	During this period, individuals within the German military were advocating a preemptive strike against Russia, but Bismarck knew that such ideas were foolhardy.
105	He once wrote that \\"the most brilliant victories would not avail against the Russian nation, because of its climate, its desert, and its frugality, and having but one frontier to defend\\", and because it would leave Germany with another bitter, resentful neighbour.
106	Meanwhile, the chancellor remained wary of any foreign policy developments that looked even remotely warlike.
107	In 1886, he moved to stop an attempted sale of horses to France on the grounds that they might be used for cavalry and also ordered an investigation into large Russian purchases of medicine from a German chemical works.
108	Bismarck stubbornly refused to listen to Georg Herbert zu Munster (ambassador to France), who reported back that the French were not seeking a revanchist war, and in fact were desperate for peace at all costs.
109	Bismarck and most of his contemporaries were conservative-minded and focused their foreign policy attention on Germany's neighbouring states.
110	In 1914, 60% of German foreign investment was in Europe, as opposed to just 5% of British investment.
111	Most of the money went to developing nations such as Russia that lacked the capital or technical knowledge to industrialize on their own.
112	The construction of the Baghdad Railway, financed by German banks, was designed to eventually connect Germany with the Turkish Empire and the Persian Gulf, but it also collided with British and Russian geopolitical interests.
113	Many consider Bismarck's foreign policy as a coherent system and partly responsible for the preservation of Europe's stability.
114	It was also marked by the need to balance circumspect defensiveness and the desire to be free from the constraints of its position as a major European power.
115	Unfortunately, Bismark's successors did not pursue his foreign policy legacy.
116	For instance, Kaiser Wilhelm II, who dismissed the chancellor in 1890, let the treaty with Russia lapse in favor of Germany's alliance with Austria, which finally led to a stronger coalition-building between Russia and France.
117	ColoniesA postage stamp from the Carolines Bismarck secured a number of German colonial possessions during the 1880s in Africa and the Pacific, but he never considered an overseas colonial empire valuable due to fierce resistance to German colonial rule from the natives.
118	Thus, Germany's colonies remained badly undeveloped.
119	However they excited the interest of the religious-minded, who supported an extensive network of missionaries.
120	Germans had dreamed of colonial imperialism since 1848.
121	Bismarck began the process, and by 1884 had acquired German New Guinea.
122	By the 1890s, German colonial expansion in Asia and the Pacific (Kiauchau in China, Tientsin in China, the Marianas, the Caroline Islands, Samoa) led to frictions with the UK, Russia, Japan, and the US.
123	The largest colonial enterprises were in Africa, where the Herero Wars in what is now Namibia in 1906–07 resulted in the Herero and Namaqua Genocide EconomyBy 1900, Germany became the largest economy in Europe and the second largest in the world behind the United States.
124	Previously, the United Kingdom held that spot.
125	Germany's main economic rivals were the United Kingdom and the United States.
126	Throughout its existence, it experienced economic growth and modernization led by heavy industry.
127	In 1871, it had a largely rural population of 41 million, while by 1913 this had increased to a predominantly urban population of 68 million.
128	Industrial powerFor 30 years, Germany struggled against Britain to be Europe's leading industrial power.
129	Representative of Germany's industry was the steel giant Krupp, whose first factory was built in Essen.
130	By 1902, the factory alone became \\"A great city with its own streets, its own police force, fire department and traffic laws.
131	There are 150 kilometres of rail, 60 different factory buildings, 8,500 machine tools, seven electrical stations, 140 kilometres of underground cable and 46 overhead.
132	\\"Under Bismarck, Germany was a world innovator in building the welfare state.
133	German workers enjoyed health, accident and maternity benefits, canteens, changing rooms and a national pension scheme.
134	RailwaysLacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways.
135	In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry.
136	However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth.
137	Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen.
138	By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and forged ahead of France.
139	The total length of German railroad tracks expanded from 21,000 kilometers in 1871 to 63,000 kilometres by 1913, establishing the largest rail network in the world after the United States, and effectively surpassing the 32,000 kilometers of rail that connected Britain in the same year.
140	IndustryKrupp Works in Essen, 1890 Industrialisation progressed dynamically in Germany, and German manufacturers began to capture domestic markets from British imports, and also to compete with British industry abroad, particularly in the U.S.
141	The German textile and metal industries had by 1870 surpassed those of Britain in organisation and technical efficiency and superseded British manufacturers in the domestic market.
142	Germany became the dominant economic power on the continent and was the second largest exporting nation after Britain.
143	Technological progress during German industrialisation occurred in four waves: the railway wave (1877–1886), the dye wave (1887–1896), the chemical wave (1897–1902), and the wave of electrical engineering (1903–1918).
144	Since Germany industrialised later than Britain, it was able to model its factories after those of Britain, thus making more efficient use of its capital and avoiding legacy methods in its leap to the envelope of technology.
145	Germany invested more heavily than the British in research, especially in chemistry, motors and electricity.
146	Germany's dominance in physics and chemistry was such that one-third of all Nobel Prizes went to German inventors and researchers.
147	The German cartel system (known as Konzerne), being significantly concentrated, was able to make more efficient use of capital.
148	Germany was not weighted down with an expensive worldwide empire that needed defense.
149	Following Germany's annexation of Alsace-Lorraine in 1871, it absorbed parts of what had been France's industrial base.
150	By 1900, the German chemical industry dominated the world market for synthetic dyes.
151	The three major firms BASF, Bayer and Hoechst produced several hundred different dyes, along with the five smaller firms.
152	In 1913, these eight firms produced almost 90% of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80% of their production abroad.
153	The three major firms had also integrated upstream into the production of essential raw materials and they began to expand into other areas of chemistry such as pharmaceuticals, photographic film, agricultural chemicals and electrochemicals.
154	Top-level decision-making was in the hands of professional salaried managers; leading Chandler to call the German dye companies \\"the world's first truly managerial industrial enterprises\\".
155	There were many spinoffs from research—such as the pharmaceutical industry, which emerged from chemical research.
156	By the start of World War I (1914–1918), German industry switched to war production.
157	The heaviest demands were on coal and steel for artillery and shell production, and on chemicals for the synthesis of materials that were subject to import restrictions and for chemical weapons and war supplies.
158	ConsolidationThe creation of the Empire under Prussian leadership was a victory for the concept of Kleindeutschland (Smaller Germany) over the Großdeutschland concept.
159	This meant that Austria-Hungary, a multi-ethnic Empire with a considerable German-speaking population, would remain outside of the German nation state.
160	Bismarck's policy was to pursue a solution diplomatically.
161	The effective alliance between Germany and Austria played a major role in Germany's decision to enter World War I in 1914.
162	Bismarck announced there would be no more territorial additions to Germany in Europe, and his diplomacy after 1871 was focused on stabilizing the European system and preventing any wars.
163	He succeeded, and only after his ouster in 1890 did the diplomatic tensions start rising again.
164	Social issuesAfter achieving formal unification in 1871, Bismarck devoted much of his attention to the cause of national unity.
165	He opposed conservative Catholic activism and emancipation, especially the powers of the Vatican under Pope Pius IX, and working class radicalism, represented by the emerging Social Democratic Party.
166	KulturkampfTensions between Germany and the Catholic Church hierarchy are depicted in a chess game between Bismarck and Pope Pius IX.
167	Between Berlin and Rome, Kladderadatsch, 1875.
168	Prussia in 1871 included 16,000,000 Protestants, both Reformed and Lutheran, and 8,000,000 Catholics.
169	Most people were generally segregated into their own religious worlds, living in rural districts or city neighbourhoods that were overwhelmingly of the same religion, and sending their children to separate public schools where their religion was taught.
170	There was little interaction or intermarriage.
171	On the whole, the Protestants had a higher social status, and the Catholics were more likely to be peasant farmers or unskilled or semiskilled industrial workers.
172	In 1870, the Catholics formed their own political party, the Centre Party, which generally supported unification and most of Bismarck's policies.
173	However, Bismarck distrusted parliamentary democracy in general and opposition parties in particular, especially when the Centre Party showed signs of gaining support among dissident elements such as the Polish Catholics in Silesia.
174	A powerful intellectual force of the time was anti-Catholicism, led by the liberal intellectuals who formed a vital part of Bismarck's coalition.
175	They saw the Catholic Church as a powerful force of reaction and anti-modernity, especially after the proclamation of papal infallibility in 1870, and the tightening control of the Vatican over the local bishops.
176	The Kulturkampf launched by Bismarck 1871–1880 affected Prussia; although there were similar movements in Baden and Hesse, the rest of Germany was not affected.
177	According to the new imperial constitution, the states were in charge of religious and educational affairs; they funded the Protestant and Catholic schools.
178	In July 1871 Bismarck abolished the Catholic section of the Prussian Ministry of ecclesiastical and educational affairs, depriving Catholics of their voice at the highest level.
179	The system of strict government supervision of schools was applied only in Catholic areas; the Protestant schools were left alone.
180	Much more serious were the May laws of 1873.
181	One made the appointment of any priest dependent on his attendance at a German university, as opposed to the seminaries that the Catholics typically used.
182	Furthermore, all candidates for the ministry had to pass an examination in German culture before a state board which weeded out intransigent Catholics.
183	Another provision gave the government a veto power over most church activities.
184	A second law abolished the jurisdiction of the Vatican over the Catholic Church in Prussia; its authority was transferred to a government body controlled by Protestants.
185	Nearly all German bishops, clergy, and laymen rejected the legality of the new laws, and were defiant in the face of heavier and heavier penalties and imprisonments imposed by Bismarck's government.
186	By 1876, all the Prussian bishops were imprisoned or in exile, and a third of the Catholic parishes were without a priest.
187	In the face of systematic defiance, the Bismarck government increased the penalties and its attacks, and were challenged in 1875 when a papal encyclical declared the whole ecclesiastical legislation of Prussia was invalid, and threatened to excommunicate any Catholic who obeyed.
188	There was no violence, but the Catholics mobilized their support, set up numerous civic organizations, raised money to pay fines, and rallied behind their church and the Centre Party.
189	The \\"Old Catholic Church\\", which rejected the First Vatican Council, attracted only a few thousand members.
190	Bismarck, a devout pietistic Protestant, realized his Kulturkampf was backfiring when secular and socialist elements used the opportunity to attack all religion.
191	In the long run, the most significant result was the mobilization of the Catholic voters, and their insistence on protecting their religious identity.
192	In the elections of 1874, the Centre party doubled its popular vote, and became the second-largest party in the national parliament—and remained a powerful force for the next 60 years, so that after Bismarck it became difficult to form a government without their support.
193	Social reformBismarck built on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as in the 1840s.
194	In the 1880s he introduced old-age pensions, accident insurance, medical care and unemployment insurance that formed the basis of the modern European welfare state.
195	He came to realize that this sort of policy was very appealing, since it bound workers to the state, and also fit in very well with his authoritarian nature.
196	The social security systems installed by Bismarck (health care in 1883, accident insurance in 1884, invalidity and old-age insurance in 1889) at the time were the largest in the world and, to a degree, still exist in Germany today.
197	Bismarck's paternalistic programs won the support of German industry because its goals were to win the support of the working classes for the Empire and reduce the outflow of immigrants to America, where wages were higher but welfare did not exist.
198	Bismarck further won the support of both industry and skilled workers by his high tariff policies, which protected profits and wages from American competition, although they alienated the liberal intellectuals who wanted free trade.
199	GermanisationOne of the effects of the unification policies was the gradually increasing tendency to eliminate the use of non-German languages in public life, schools and academic settings with the intent of pressuring the non-German population to abandon their national identity in what was called \\"Germanisation\\".
200	These policies often had the reverse effect of stimulating resistance, usually in the form of home schooling and tighter unity in the minority groups, especially the Poles.
201	The Germanisation policies were targeted particularly against the significant Polish minority of the empire, gained by Prussia in the partitions of Poland.
202	Poles were treated as an ethnic minority even where they made up the majority, as in the Province of Posen, where a series of anti-Polish measures was enforced.
203	Numerous anti-Polish laws had no great effect especially in the province of Posen where the German-speaking population dropped from 42.8% in 1871 to 38.1% in 1905, despite all efforts.
204	AntisemitismAntisemitism was endemic in Germany during the period.
205	Before Napoleon's decrees ended the ghettos in Germany, it had been religiously motivated, but by the 19th century, it was a factor in German nationalism.
206	The last legal barriers on Jews in Prussia were lifted by the 1860s, and within 20 years, they were over-represented in the white-collar professions and much of academia.
207	In the popular mind Jews became a symbol of capitalism and wealth.
208	On the other hand, the constitution and legal system protected the rights of Jews as German citizens.
209	Antisemitic parties were formed but soon collapsed.
210	LawBismarck's efforts also initiated the levelling of the enormous differences between the German states, which had been independent in their evolution for centuries, especially with legislation.
211	The completely different legal histories and judicial systems posed enormous complications, especially for national trade.
212	While a common trade code had already been introduced by the Confederation in 1861 (which was adapted for the Empire and, with great modifications, is still in effect today), there was little similarity in laws otherwise.
213	In 1871, a common Criminal Code (Reichsstrafgesetzbuch) was introduced; in 1877, common court procedures were established in the court system (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz), civil procedures (Zivilprozessordnung) and criminal procedures (Strafprozessordnung).
214	In 1873 the constitution was amended to allow the Empire to replace the various and greatly differing Civil Codes of the states (If they existed at all; for example, parts of Germany formerly occupied by Napoleon's France had adopted the French Civil Code, while in Prussia the Allgemeines Preußisches Landrecht of 1794 was still in effect).
215	In 1881, a first commission was established to produce a common Civil Code for all of the Empire, an enormous effort that would produce the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB), possibly one of the most impressive legal works in the world; it was eventually put into effect on 1 January 1900.
216	All of these codifications are, albeit with many amendments, still in effect today.
217	Year of three emperorsFrederick III, emperor for only 99 days (9 March15 June 1888).
218	On 9 March 1888, Wilhelm I died shortly before his 91st birthday, leaving his son Frederick III as the new emperor.
219	Frederick was a liberal and an admirer of the British constitution, while his links to Britain strengthened further with his marriage to Princess Victoria, eldest child of Queen Victoria.
220	With his ascent to the throne, many hoped that Frederick's reign would lead to a liberalisation of the Reich and an increase of parliament's influence on the political process.
221	The dismissal of Robert von Puttkamer, the highly-conservative Prussian interior minister, on 8 June was a sign of the expected direction and a blow to Bismarck's administration.
222	By the time of his accession, however, Frederick had developed incurable laryngeal cancer, which had been diagnosed in 1887.
223	He died on the 99th day of his rule, on 15 June 1888.
224	His son Wilhelm II became emperor.

226	Oil painting by Max Koner, 1890.
227	Wilhelm II wanted to reassert his ruling prerogatives at a time when other monarchs in Europe were being transformed into constitutional figureheads.
228	This decision led the ambitious Kaiser into conflict with Bismarck.
229	The old chancellor had hoped to guide Wilhelm as he had guided his grandfather, but the emperor wanted to be the master in his own house and had many sycophants telling him that Frederick the Great would not have been great with a Bismarck at his side.
230	A key difference between Wilhelm II and Bismarck was their approaches to handling political crises, especially in 1889, when German coal miners went on strike in Upper Silesia.
231	Bismarck demanded that the German Army be sent in to crush the strike, but Wilhelm II rejected this authoritarian measure, responding \\"I do not wish to stain my reign with the blood of my subjects.\\"
232	Instead of condoning repression, Wilhelm had the government negotiate with a delegation from the coal miners, which brought the strike to an end without violence.
233	The fractious relationship ended in March 1890, after Wilhelm II and Bismarck quarrelled, and the chancellor resigned days later.
234	Bismarck's last few years had seen power slip from his hands as he grew older, more irritable, more authoritarian, and less focused.
235	With Bismarck's departure, Wilhelm II became the dominant ruler of Germany.
236	Unlike his grandfather, Wilhelm I, who had been largely content to leave government affairs to the chancellor, Wilhelm II wanted to be fully informed and actively involved in running Germany, not an ornamental figurehead, although most Germans found his claims of divine right to rule amusing.
237	Wilhelm allowed politician Walther Rathenau to tutor him in European economics and industrial and financial realities in Europe.
238	As Hull (2004) notes, Bismarckian foreign policy \\"was too sedate for the reckless Kaiser\\".
239	Wilhelm became internationally notorious for his aggressive stance on foreign policy and his strategic blunders (such as the Tangier Crisis), which pushed the German Empire into growing political isolation and eventually helped to cause World War I.Domestic affairsThe Reichstag in the 1890s\\\\early 1900s.
240	Under Wilhelm II, Germany no longer had long-ruling strong chancellors like Bismarck.
241	The new chancellors had difficulty in performing their roles, especially the additional role as Prime Minister of Prussia assigned to them in the German Constitution.
242	The reforms of Chancellor Leo von Caprivi, which liberalized trade and so reduced unemployment, were supported by the Kaiser and most Germans except for Prussian landowners, who feared loss of land and power and launched several campaigns against the reforms.
243	While Prussian aristocrats challenged the demands of a united German state, in the 1890s several organizations were set up to challenge the authoritarian conservative Prussian militarism which was being imposed on the country.
244	Educators opposed to the German state-run schools, which emphasized military education, set up their own independent liberal schools, which encouraged individuality and freedom.
245	However nearly all the schools in Imperial Germany had a very high standard and kept abreast with modern developments in knowledge.
246	Artists began experimental art in opposition to Kaiser Wilhelm's support for traditional art, to which Wilhelm responded \\"art which transgresses the laws and limits laid down by me can no longer be called art\\".
247	It was largely thanks to Wilhelm's influence that most printed material in Germany used blackletter instead of the Roman type used in the rest of Western Europe.
248	At the same time, a new generation of cultural creators emerged.
249	Berlin in the late 19th century From the 1890s onwards, the most effective opposition to the monarchy came from the newly formed Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), whose radicals advocated Marxism.
250	The threat of the SPD to the German monarchy and industrialists caused the state both to crack down on the party's supporters and to implement its own programme of social reform to soothe discontent.
251	Germany's large industries provided significant social welfare programmes and good care to their employees, as long as they were not identified as socialists or trade-union members.
252	The larger industrial firms provided pensions, sickness benefits and even housing to their employees.
253	Having learned from the failure of Bismarck's Kulturkampf, Wilhelm II maintained good relations with the Roman Catholic Church and concentrated on opposing socialism.
254	This policy failed when the Social Democrats won a third of the votes in the 1912 elections to the Reichstag, and became the largest political party in Germany.
255	The government remained in the hands of a succession of conservative coalitions supported by right-wing liberals or Catholic clerics and heavily dependent on the Kaiser's favour.
256	The rising militarism under Wilhelm II caused many Germans to emigrate to the U.S. and the British colonies to escape mandatory military service.
257	During World War I, the Kaiser increasingly devolved his powers to the leaders of the German High Command, particularly future President of Germany, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff.
258	Hindenburg took over the role of commander–in–chief from the Kaiser, while Ludendorff became de facto general chief of staff.
259	By 1916, Germany was effectively a military dictatorship run by Hindenburg and Ludendorff, with the Kaiser reduced to a mere figurehead.
260	Foreign affairsBismarck at the Berlin Conference, 1884 Wilhelm II wanted Germany to have her \\"place in the sun\\", like Britain, which he constantly wished to emulate or rival.
261	With German traders and merchants already active worldwide, he encouraged colonial efforts in Africa and the Pacific (\\"new imperialism\\"), causing the German Empire to vie with other European powers for remaining \\"unclaimed\\" territories.
262	With the encouragement or at least the acquiescence of Britain, which at this stage saw Germany as a counterweight to her old rival France, Germany acquired German Southwest Africa (modern Namibia), German Kamerun (modern Cameroon), Togoland (modern Togo) and German East Africa (modern Rwanda, Burundi, and the mainland part of current Tanzania).
263	Islands were gained in the Pacific through purchase and treaties and also a 99-year lease for the territory of Kiautschou in northeast China.
264	But of these German colonies only Togoland and German Samoa (after 1908) became self-sufficient and profitable; all the others required subsidies from the Berlin treasury for building infrastructure, school systems, hospitals and other institutions.
265	German colonial flag Bismarck had originally dismissed the agitation for colonies with contempt; he favoured a Eurocentric foreign policy, as the treaty arrangements made during his tenure in office show.
266	As a latecomer to colonization, Germany repeatedly came into conflict with the established colonial powers and also with the United States, which opposed German attempts at colonial expansion in both the Caribbean and the Pacific.
267	Native insurrections in German territories received prominent coverage in other countries, especially in Britain; the established powers had dealt with such uprisings decades earlier, often brutally, and had secured firm control of their colonies by then.
268	The Boxer Rising in China, which the Chinese government eventually sponsored, began in the Shandong province, in part because Germany, as colonizer at Kiautschou, was an untested power and had only been active there for two years.
269	Eight western nations, including the United States, mounted a joint relief force to rescue westerners caught up in the rebellion.
270	During the departure ceremonies for the German contingent, Wilhelm II urged them to behave like the Hun invaders of continental Europe – an unfortunate remark that would later be resurrected by British propagandists to paint Germans as barbarians during World War I and World War II.
271	On two occasions, a French-German conflict over the fate of Morocco seemed inevitable.
272	Hoisting the German flag at Mioko, German New Guinea in 1884 Upon acquiring Southwest Africa, German settlers were encouraged to cultivate land held by the Herero and Nama.
273	Herero and Nama tribal lands were used for a variety of exploitative goals (much as the British did before in Rhodesia), including farming, ranching, and mining for minerals and diamonds.
274	In 1904, the Herero and the Nama revolted against the colonists in Southwest Africa, killing farm families, their laborers and servants.
275	In response to the attacks, troops were dispatched to quell the uprising which then resulted in the Herero and Namaqua Genocide.
276	In total, some 65,000 Herero (80% of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Nama (50% of the total Nama population) perished.
277	The commander of the punitive expedition, General Lothar von Trotha, was eventually relieved and reprimanded for his usurpation of orders and the cruelties he inflicted.
278	These occurrences were sometimes referred to as \\"the first genocide of the 20th century\\" and officially condemned by the United Nations in 1985.
279	In 2004 a formal apology by a government minister of the Federal Republic of Germany followed.
280	Middle EastBismarck and Wilhelm II after him sought closer economic ties with the Ottoman Empire.
281	Under Wilhelm II, with the financial backing of the Deutsche Bank, the Baghdad Railway was begun in 1900, although by 1914 it was still  short of its destination in Baghdad.
282	In an interview with Wilhelm in 1899, Cecil Rhodes had tried \\"to convince the Kaiser that the future of the German empire abroad lay in the Middle East\\" and not in Africa; with a grand Middle-Eastern empire, Germany could afford to allow Britain the unhindered completion of the Cape-to-Cairo railway that Rhodes favoured.
283	Britain initially supported the Baghdad Railway; but by 1911 British statesmen came to fear it might be extended to Basra on the Persian Gulf, threatening Britain's naval supremacy in the Indian Ocean.
284	Accordingly, they asked to have construction halted, to which Germany and the Ottoman Empire acquiesced.
285	EuropeWilhelm II and his advisers committed a fatal diplomatic error when they allowed the \\"Reinsurance Treaty\\" that Bismarck had negotiated with Tsarist Russia to lapse.
286	Germany was left with no firm ally but Austria-Hungary, and her support for action in annexing Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908 further soured relations with Russia.
287	Wilhelm missed the opportunity to secure an alliance with Britain in the 1890s when it was involved in colonial rivalries with France, and he alienated British statesmen further by openly supporting the Boers in the South African War and building a navy to rival Britain's.
288	By 1911 Wilhelm had completely picked apart the careful power balance established by Bismarck and Britain turned to France in the Entente Cordiale.
289	Germany's only other ally besides Austria was the Kingdom of Italy, but it remained an ally only pro forma.
290	When war came, Italy saw more benefit in an alliance with Britain, France, and Russia, which, in the secret Treaty of London in 1915 promised it the frontier districts of Austria where Italians formed the majority of the population and also colonial concessions.
291	Germany did acquire a second ally that same year when the Ottoman Empire entered the war on its side, but in the long run supporting the Ottoman war effort only drained away German resources from the main fronts.
292	World War IOriginsMap of the world showing the participants in World War I.
293	Those fighting on the Entente's side (at one point or another) are depicted in green, the Central Powers in orange, and neutral countries in grey.
294	Following the assassination of the Austro-Hungarian Archduke of  Franz Ferdinand by  a Bosnian Serb, the Kaiser offered Emperor Franz Joseph full support for Austro-Hungarian plans to invade the Kingdom of Serbia, which Austria-Hungary blamed for the assassination.
295	This unconditional support for Austria-Hungary was called a \\"blank cheque\\" by historians, including German Fritz Fischer.
296	Subsequent interpretation – for example at the Versailles Peace Conference – was that this \\"blank cheque\\" licensed Austro-Hungarian aggression regardless of the diplomatic consequences, and thus Germany bore responsibility for starting the war, or at least provoking a wider conflict.
297	Germany began the war by targeting its chief rival, France.
298	Germany saw France as its principal danger on the European continent as it could mobilize much faster than Russia and bordered Germany's industrial core in the Rhineland.
299	Unlike Britain and Russia, the French entered the war mainly for revenge against Germany, in particular for France's loss of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany in 1871.
300	The German high command knew that France would muster its forces to go into Alsace-Lorraine.
301	Aside from the very unofficial Septemberprogramm, the Germans never stated a clear list of goals that they wanted out of the war.
302	Western FrontThe mobilization in 1914 Germany did not want to risk lengthy battles along the Franco-German border and instead adopted the Schlieffen Plan, a military strategy designed to cripple France by invading Belgium and Luxembourg, sweeping down to encircle and crush both Paris and the French forces along the Franco-German border in a quick victory.
303	After defeating France, Germany would turn to attack Russia.
304	The plan required violating the official neutrality of Belgium and Luxembourg, which Britain had guaranteed by treaty.
305	However, the Germans had calculated that Britain would enter the war regardless of whether they had formal justification to do so.
306	At first the attack was successful: the German Army swept down from Belgium and Luxembourg and advanced on Paris, at the nearby River Marne.
307	However, the evolution of weapons over the last century heavily favored defense over offense, especially thanks to the machine gun, so that it took proportionally more offensive force to overcome a defensive position.
308	This resulted in the German lines on the offense contracting to keep up the offensive time table while correspondingly the French lines were extending.
309	In addition, some German units that were originally slotted for the German far right were transferred to the Eastern Front in reaction to Russia mobilizing far faster than anticipated.
310	The combined affect had the German right flank sweeping down in front of Paris instead of behind it exposing the German Right flank to the extending French lines and attack from strategic French reserves stationed in Paris.
311	Attacking the exposed German right flank, the French Army and the British Army put up a strong resistance to the defense of Paris at the First Battle of the Marne, resulting in the German Army retreating.
312	The aftermath of the First Battle of the Marne was a long-held stalemate between the German Army and the Allies in dug-in trench warfare.
313	Further German attempts to break through deeper into France failed at the two battles of Ypres (1st/2nd) with huge casualties.
314	German Chief of Staff Erich von Falkenhayn decided to break away from the Schlieffen Plan and instead focus on a war of attrition against France.
315	Falkenhayn targeted the ancient city of Verdun because it had been one of the last cities to hold out against the German Army in 1870, and Falkenhayn knew that as a matter of national pride the French would do anything to ensure that it was not taken.
316	He expected that with proper tactics, French losses would be greater than those of the Germans and that continued French commitment of troops to Verdun would \\"bleed the French Army white\\" and then allow the German army to take France easily.
317	In 1916, the Battle of Verdun began, with the French positions under constant shelling and poison gas attack and taking large casualties under the assault of overwhelmingly large German forces.
318	However, Falkenhayn's prediction of a greater ratio of French killed proved to be wrong.
319	Falkenhayn was replaced by Erich Ludendorff, and with no success in sight, the German Army pulled out of Verdun in December 1916 and the battle ended.
320	Eastern FrontFront line at the time of cease-fire and at the time of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk While the Western Front was a stalemate for the German Army, the Eastern Front eventually proved to be a great success.
321	Despite initial setbacks due to the unexpectedly rapid mobilisation of the Russian army, which resulted in a Russian invasion of East Prussia and Austrian Galicia, the badly organised and supplied Russian Army faltered and the German and Austro-Hungarian armies thereafter steadily advanced eastward.
322	The Germans benefited from political instability in Russia and its population's desire to end the war.
323	In 1917 the German government allowed Russia's communist Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin to travel through Germany from Switzerland into Russia.
324	Germany believed that if Lenin could create further political unrest, Russia would no longer be able to continue its war with Germany, allowing the German Army to focus on the Western Front.
325	In March 1917, the Tsar was ousted from the Russian throne, and in November a Bolshevik government came to power under the leadership of Lenin.
326	Facing political opposition from the Bolsheviks, he decided to end Russia's campaign against Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria in order to redirect Bolshevik energy to eliminating internal dissent.
327	In March 1918, by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Bolshevik government gave Germany and the Ottoman Empire enormous territorial and economic concessions in exchange for an end to war on the Eastern Front.
328	All of the modern-day Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) were given over to the German occupation authority Ober Ost, along with Belarus and Ukraine.
329	Thus Germany had at last achieved its long-wanted dominance of \\"Mitteleuropa\\" (Central Europe) and could now focus fully on defeating the Allies on the Western Front.
330	In practice, however, the forces that were needed to garrison and secure the new territories were a drain on the German war effort.
331	ColoniesGermany quickly lost almost all its colonies.
332	However, in German East Africa, an impressive guerrilla campaign was waged by the colonial army leader there, General Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck.
333	Using Germans and native Askaris, Lettow-Vorbeck launched multiple guerrilla raids against British forces in Kenya and Rhodesia.
334	He also invaded Portuguese Mozambique to gain his forces supplies and to pick up more Askari recruits.
335	His force was still active at war's end.
336	1918
337	Defeating Russia in 1917 enabled Germany to transfer hundreds of thousands of combat troops from the east to the Western Front, giving it a numerical advantage over the Allies.
338	By retraining the soldiers in new stormtrooper tactics, the Germans expected to unfreeze the battlefield and win a decisive victory before the army of the United States, which had now entered the war on the side of Britain and France, arrived in strength.
339	However, the repeated German offensives in the spring of 1918 all failed, as the Allies fell back and regrouped and the Germans lacked the reserves needed to consolidate their gains.
340	Meanwhile, soldiers had become radicalised by the Russian Revolution and were less willing to continue fighting.
341	The war effort sparked civil unrest in Germany, while the troops, who had been constantly in the field without relief, grew exhausted and lost all hope of victory.
342	In the summer of 1918, with the Americans arriving at the rate of 10,000 a day and the German reserves spent, it was only a matter of time before multiple Allied offensives destroyed the German army.
343	Home frontA memorial to soldiers killed in World War I The concept of \\"total war\\" meant that supplies had to be redirected towards the armed forces and, with German commerce being stopped by the Allied naval blockade, German civilians were forced to live in increasingly meagre conditions.
344	First food prices were controlled, then rationing was introduced.
345	During the war about 750,000 German civilians died from malnutrition.
346	Towards the end of the war conditions deteriorated rapidly on the home front, with severe food shortages reported in all urban areas.
347	The causes included the transfer of many farmers and food workers into the military, combined with the overburdened railway system, shortages of coal, and the British blockade.
348	The winter of 1916–1917 was known as the \\"turnip winter\\", because the people had to survive on a vegetable more commonly reserved for livestock, as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce.
349	Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves.
350	Even the army had to cut the soldiers' rations.
351	The morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink.
352	Revolt and demiseMany Germans wanted an end to the war and increasing numbers began to associate with the political left, such as the Social Democratic Party and the more radical Independent Social Democratic Party, which demanded an end to the war.
353	The entry of the U.S. into the war in April 1917 changed the long-run balance of power in favour of the Allies.
354	The end of October 1918, in Kiel, in northern Germany, saw the beginning of the German Revolution of 1918–1919.
355	Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war which they saw as good as lost, initiating the uprising.
356	On 3 November, the revolt spread to other cities and states of the country, in many of which workers' and soldiers' councils were established.
357	Meanwhile, Hindenburg and the senior generals lost confidence in the Kaiser and his government.
358	Bulgaria signed the Armistice of Solun on 29 September 1918.
359	The Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918.
360	Between 24 October and 3 November 1918, Italy defeated Austria-Hungary in the battle of Vittorio Veneto, which forced Austria-Hungary to sign the Armistice of Villa Giusti on 3 November 1918.
361	So, in November 1918, with internal revolution, the Allies advancing toward Germany on the Western Front, Austria-Hungary falling apart from multiple ethnic tensions, its other allies out of the war and pressure from the German high command, the Kaiser and all German ruling princes abdicated.
362	On 9 November, the Social Democrat Philipp Scheidemann proclaimed a republic.
363	The new government led by the German Social Democrats called for and received an armistice on 11 November.
364	It was succeeded by the Weimar Republic.
365	Those opposed, including disaffected veterans, joined a diverse set of paramilitary and underground political groups such as the Freikorps, the Organisation Consul, and the Communists.
366	ConstitutionThe Empire's legislation was based on two organs, the Bundesrat and the Reichstag (parliament).
367	There was universal male suffrage for the Reichstag, however legislation would have to pass both houses.
368	The Bundesrat contained representatives of the states.
369	Constituent statesCoat of arms and flags of the constituent states in the year 1900 Before unification, German territory (excluding Austria and Switzerland) was made up of 27 constituent states.
370	These states consisted of kingdoms, grand duchies, duchies, principalities, free Hanseatic cities and one imperial territory.
371	The free cities had a republican form of government on the state level, even though the Empire at large was constituted as a monarchy, and so were most of the states.
372	The Kingdom of Prussia was the largest of the constituent states, covering two-thirds of the empire's territory.
373	Several of these states had gained sovereignty following the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, and had been de facto sovereign from the mid-1600s onward.
374	Others were created as sovereign states after the Congress of Vienna in 1815.
375	Territories were not necessarily contiguous—many existed in several parts, as a result of historical acquisitions, or, in several cases, divisions of the ruling families.
376	Some of the initially existing states, in particular Hanover, were abolished and annexed by Prussia as a result of the war of 1866.
377	Each component of the German Empire sent representatives to the Federal Council (Bundesrat) and, via single-member districts, the Imperial Diet (Reichstag).
378	Relations between the Imperial centre and the Empire's components were somewhat fluid and were developed on an ongoing basis.
379	The extent to which the Emperor could, for example, intervene on occasions of disputed or unclear succession was much debated on occasion—for example in the inheritance crisis of the Lippe-Detmold.

382	The non-German Germanic languages (0.5%), like Danish, Dutch and Frisian, were located in the north and northwest of the empire, near the borders with Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.
383	Low German was spoken throughout northern Germany and, though linguistically as distinct from High German (Hochdeutsch) as from Dutch and English, is considered \\"German\\", hence also its name.
384	Danish and Frisian were spoken predominantly in the north of the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein and Dutch in the western border areas of Prussia (Hanover, Westphalia, and the Rhine Province).
385	Polish and other Slavic languages (6.28%) were spoken chiefly in the east.
386	A few (0.5%) spoke French, especially in the Reichsland Elsass-Lothringen, where French-speakers formed 11.6% of the total population.

389	Generally, religious demographics of the early modern period hardly changed.
390	Still, there were almost entirely Catholic areas (Lower and Upper Bavaria, northern Westphalia, Upper Silesia, etc.) and almost entirely Protestant areas (Schleswig-Holstein, Pomerania, Saxony, etc.).
391	Confessional prejudices, especially towards mixed marriages, were still common.
392	Bit by bit, through internal migration, religious blending was more and more common.
393	In eastern territories, confession was almost uniquely perceived to be connected to one's ethnicity and the equation \\"Protestant =
394	German, Catholic = Polish\\" was held to be valid.
395	In areas affected by immigration in the Ruhr area and Westphalia, as well as in some large cities, religious landscape changed substantially.
396	This was especially true in largely Catholic areas of Westphalia, which changed through Protestant immigration from the eastern provinces.
397	Politically, the confessional division of Germany had considerable consequences.
398	In Catholic areas, the Centre Party had a big electorate.
399	On the other hand, Social Democrats and Free Trade Unions usually received hardly any votes in the Catholic areas of the Ruhr.
400	This began to change with the secularization arising in the last decades of the German Empire.

402	Conservatives, liberals, socialists, nationalists, Catholics and Protestants all had their own interpretations, which led to a fractious political and social climate in Germany in the aftermath of the empire's collapse.
403	War flag of the German Empire.
404	In 1956, the Iron Cross was re-introduced as the symbol of the Bundeswehr, the modern German armed forces.
405	Under Bismarck, a united German state had finally been achieved, but it remained a Prussian-dominated state and did not include German Austria as Pan-German nationalists had desired.
406	The influence of Prussian militarism, the Empire's colonial efforts and its vigorous, competitive industrial prowess all gained it the dislike and envy of other nations.
407	The German Empire enacted a number of progressive reforms, such as Europe's first social welfare system and freedom of press.
408	There was also a modern system for electing the federal parliament, the Reichstag, in which every adult man had one vote.
409	This enabled the Socialists and the Catholic Centre Party to play considerable roles in the empire's political life despite the continued hostility of Prussian aristocrats.
410	The era of the German Empire is well remembered in Germany as one of great cultural and intellectual vigour.
411	Thomas Mann published his novel Buddenbrooks in 1901.
412	Theodor Mommsen received the Nobel prize for literature a year later for his Roman history.
413	Painters like the groups Der Blaue Reiter and Die Brücke made a significant contribution to modern art.
414	The AEG turbine factory in Berlin by Peter Behrens from 1909 can be regarded as a milestone in classic modern architecture and an outstanding example of emerging functionalism.
415	The social, economic, and scientific successes of this Gründerzeit, or founding epoch, have sometimes led the Wilhelmine era to be regarded as a golden age.
416	In the field of economics, the \\"Kaiserzeit\\" laid the foundation of Germany's status as one of the world's leading economic powers.
417	The iron and coal industries of the Ruhr, the Saar and Upper Silesia especially contributed to that process.
418	The first motorcar was built by Karl Benz in 1886.
419	The enormous growth of industrial production and industrial potential also led to a rapid urbanisation of Germany, which turned the Germans into a nation of city dwellers.
420	More than 5 million people left Germany for the United States during the 19th century.
421	SonderwegMany historians have emphasized the central importance of a German Sonderweg or \\"special path\\" (or \\"exceptionalism\\") as the root of Nazism and the German catastrophe in the 20th century.
422	According to the historiography by Kocka (1988), the process of nation-building from above had very grievous long-term implications.
423	In terms of parliamentary democracy, Parliament was kept weak, the parties were fragmented, and there was a high level of mutual distrust.
424	The Nazis built on the illiberal, anti-pluralist elements of Weimar's political culture.
425	The Junker elites (the large landowners in the east) and senior civil servants used their great power and influence well into the twentieth century to frustrate any movement toward democracy.
426	They played an especially negative role in the crisis of 1930–1933.
427	Bismarck's emphasis on military force amplified the voice of the officer corps, which combined advanced modernisation of military technology with reactionary politics.
428	The rising upper-middle class elites, in the business, financial and professional worlds, tended to accept the values of the old traditional elites.
429	The German Empire was for Hans-Ulrich Wehler a strange mixture of highly successful capitalist industrialisation and socio-economic modernisation on the one hand, and of surviving pre-industrial institutions, power relations and traditional cultures on the other.
430	Wehler argues that it produced a high degree of internal tension, which led on the one hand to the suppression of socialists, Catholics and reformers, and on the other hand to a highly aggressive foreign policy.
431	For these reasons Fritz Fischer and his students emphasised Germany's primary guilt for causing the First World War.
432	Hans-Ulrich Wehler, a leader of the Bielefeld School of social history, places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s–1870s, when economic modernisation took place, but political modernisation did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service.
433	Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernising society.
434	Recognising the importance of modernising forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus).
435	The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernisation of its political structures.
436	At the core of Wehler's interpretation is his treatment of \\"the middle class\\" and \\"revolution\\", each of which was instrumental in shaping the 20th century.
437	Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of \\"charismatic domination\\", which focuses heavily on Adolf Hitler.
438	The historiographical concept of a German Sonderweg has had a turbulent history.
439	19th century scholars who emphasised a separate German path to modernity saw it as a positive factor that differentiated Germany from the \\"western path\\" typified by Great Britain.
440	They stressed the strong bureaucratic state, reforms initiated by Bismarck and other strong leaders, the Prussian service ethos, the high culture of philosophy and music, and Germany's pioneering of a social welfare state.
441	In the 1950s, historians in West Germany argued that the Sonderweg led Germany to the disaster of 1933–1945.
442	The special circumstances of German historical structures and experiences, were interpreted as preconditions that, while not directly causing National Socialism, did hamper the development of a liberal democracy and facilitate the rise of fascism.
443	The Sonderweg paradigm has provided the impetus for at least three strands of research in German historiography: the \\"long 19th century\\", the history of the bourgeoisie, and comparisons with the West.
444	After 1990, increased attention to cultural dimensions and to comparative and relational history moved German historiography to different topics, with much less attention paid to the Sonderweg.
445	While some historians have abandoned the Sonderweg thesis, they have not provided a generally accepted alternative interpretation.
446	Territorial legacy
447	In addition to present-day Germany, large parts of what comprised the German Empire now belong to several other modern European countries.

552	With roots in blues rock, psychedelic rock, and acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness.
553	The genre's lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.
554	In 1968, three of the genre's most famous pioneers, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple were founded.
555	Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics.
556	During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed.
557	Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein.
558	Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \\"metalheads\\" or \\"headbangers\\".
559	During the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as Mötley Crüe, Poison and Def Leppard.
560	Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of heavy metal such as death metal (with bands such as Death, Possessed, and Obituary) and black metal (with bands such as Mayhem, Bathory, and Immortal) remain subcultural phenomena.
561	Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre.
562	These include groove metal (with bands such as Pantera, Sepultura, and Lamb of God) and nu metal (with bands such as Korn, Slipknot, and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop.
563	CharacteristicsHeavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound, and vigorous vocals.
564	Heavy metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter, or omit one or more of these attributes.
565	The New York Times critic Jon Pareles writes, \\"In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rock—the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force.\\"
566	The typical band lineup includes a drummer, a bassist, a rhythm guitarist, a lead guitarist, and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist.
567	Keyboard instruments are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound.
568	Deep Purple's Jon Lord played an overdriven Hammond organ.
569	In 1970, John Paul Jones used a Moog synthesizer on Led Zeppelin III; by the 1990s, in \\"almost every subgenre of heavy metal\\" synthesizers were used.
570	Judas Priest, performing in 2005.
571	The electric guitar and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal.
572	The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy distortion.
573	For classic heavy metal guitar tone, guitarists maintain moderate levels gain at moderate levels, without excessive preamp or pedal distortion, to retain open spaces and air in the music; the guitar amplifier is turned up loud to produce the characteristic \\"punch and grind\\".
574	Thrash metal guitar tone has scooped mid-frequencies and tightly compressed sound with lots of bass frequencies.
575	Guitar solos are \\"an essential element of the heavy metal code ... that underscores the significance of the guitar\\" to the genre.
576	Most heavy metal songs \\"feature at least one guitar solo\\", which is \\"a primary means through which the heavy metal performer expresses virtuosity\\".
577	Some exceptions are nu metal and grindcore bands, which tend to omit guitar solos.
578	With rhythm guitar parts, the \\"heavy crunch sound in heavy metal ...
579	[is created by] palm muting\\" the strings with the picking hand and using distortion.
580	Palm muting creates a tighter, more precise sound and it emphasizes the low end.
581	The lead role of the guitar in heavy metal often collides with the traditional \\"frontman\\" or bandleader role of the vocalist, creating a musical tension as the two \\"contend for dominance\\" in a spirit of \\"affectionate rivalry\\".
582	Heavy metal \\"demands the subordination of the voice\\" to the overall sound of the band.
583	Reflecting metal's roots in the 1960s counterculture, an \\"explicit display of emotion\\" is required from the vocals as a sign of authenticity.
584	Critic Simon Frith claims that the metal singer's \\"tone of voice\\" is more important than the lyrics.
585	The prominent role of the bass is also key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and guitar is a central element.
586	The bass guitar provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music \\"heavy\\".
587	The bass plays a \\"more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock\\".
588	Metal basslines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low pedal point as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and licks along with the lead or rhythm guitars.
589	Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's Cliff Burton with his heavy emphasis on bass guitar solos and use of chords while playing bass in the early 1980s.
590	Lemmy of Motörhead often played overdriven power chords in his bass lines.
591	The essence of heavy metal drumming is creating a loud, constant beat for the band using the \\"trifecta of speed, power, and precision\\".
592	Heavy metal drumming \\"requires an exceptional amount of endurance\\", and drummers have to develop \\"considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity ... to play the intricate patterns\\" used in  heavy metal.
593	A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it with the other hand (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound.
594	The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music.
595	Black metal, death metal and some \\"mainstream metal\\" bands \\"all depend upon double-kicks and blast beats\\".
596	Enid Williams from Girlschool and Lemmy from Motörhead singing \\"Please Don't Touch\\" live in 2009.
597	The ties that bind the two bands started in the 1980s and were still strong in the 2010s.
598	In live performance, loudness—an \\"onslaught of sound\\", in sociologist Deena Weinstein's description—is considered vital.
599	In his book Metalheads, psychologist Jeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as \\"the sensory equivalent of war\\".
600	Following the lead set by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and The Who, early heavy metal acts such as Blue Cheer set new benchmarks for volume.
601	As Blue Cheer's Dick Peterson put it, \\"All we knew was we wanted more power.\\"
602	A 1977 review of a Motörhead concert noted how \\"excessive volume in particular figured into the band's impact.\\"
603	Weinstein makes the case that in the same way that melody is the main element of pop and rhythm is the main focus of house music, powerful sound, timbre, and volume are the key elements of metal.
604	She argues that the loudness is designed to \\"sweep the listener into the sound\\" and to provide a \\"shot of youthful vitality\\".
605	Heavy metal performers tended to be almost exclusively male until at least the mid-1980s apart from exceptions such as Girlschool.
606	However, by the 2010s women were making more of an impact, and PopMatters' Craig Hayes argues that metal \\"clearly empowers women\\".
607	In the sub-genres of symphonic and power metal, there has been a sizable number of bands that have had women as the lead singers; bands such as Nightwish, Delain, and Within Temptation have featured women as lead singers with men playing instruments.
608	Musical languageRhythm and tempoAn example of a rhythmic pattern used in heavy metal.
609	The upper stave is a palm-muted rhythm guitar part.
610	The lower stave is the drum part.
611	The rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses.
612	Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the \\"rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency\\".
613	In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note or three-note rhythmic figures—generally made up of 8th or 16th notes.
614	These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a staccato attack created by using a palm-muted technique on the rhythm guitar.
615	Brief, abrupt, and detached rhythmic cells are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture.
616	These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called riffs, which help to establish thematic hooks.
617	Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as whole note- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo power ballads.
618	The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be \\"slow, even ponderous\\".
619	By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos.
620	In the 2000s decade, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note =
621	60 beats per minute) to extremely fast blast beat tempos (quarter note =
622	350 beats per minute).
623	HarmonyOne of the signatures of the genre is the guitar power chord.
624	In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main interval, generally the perfect fifth, though an octave may be added as a doubling of the root.
625	When power chords are played on the lower strings at high volumes and with distortion, additional low frequency sounds are created, which add to the \\"weight of the sound\\" and create an effect of \\"overwhelming power\\".
626	Although the perfect fifth interval is the most common basis for the power chord, power chords are also based on different intervals such as the minor third, major third, perfect fourth, diminished fifth, or minor sixth.
627	Most power chords are also played with a consistent finger arrangement that can be slid easily up and down the fretboard.
628	Typical harmonic structuresHeavy metal is usually based on riffs created with three main harmonic traits: modal scale progressions, tritone and chromatic progressions, and the use of pedal points.
629	Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the Aeolian and Phrygian modes.
630	Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-♭VI-♭VII, I-♭VII-(♭VI), or I-♭VI-IV-♭VII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and ♭II (I-♭II-I, I-♭II-III, or I-♭II-VII for example).
631	Tense-sounding chromatic or tritone relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions.
632	In addition to using modal harmonic relationships, heavy metal also uses \\"pentatonic and blues-derived features\\".
633	The tritone, an interval spanning three whole tones—such as C to F#—was a forbidden dissonance in medieval ecclesiastical singing, which led monks to call it diabolus in musica—\\"the devil in music\\".
634	Heavy metal songs often make extensive use of pedal point as a harmonic basis.
635	A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign (i.e., dissonant) harmony is sounded in the other parts.
636	According to Robert Walser, heavy metal harmonic relationships are \\"often quite complex\\" and the harmonic analysis done by metal players and teachers is \\"often very sophisticated\\".
637	In the study of heavy metal chord structures, it has been concluded that \\"heavy metal music has proved to be far more complicated\\" than other music researchers had realized.
638	Relationship with classical musicRitchie Blackmore, founder of Deep Purple and Rainbow, known for the neoclassical approach in his guitar performances.
639	Robert Walser stated that, alongside blues and R&B, the \\"assemblage of disparate musical styles known ... as 'classical music'\\" has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre's earliest days.
640	Also that metal's \\"most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music.
641	Their appropriation and adaptation of classical models sparked the development of a new kind of guitar virtuosity [and] changes in the harmonic and melodic language of heavy metal.
642	\\"In an article written for Grove Music Online, Walser stated that the \\"1980s brought on ... the widespread adaptation of chord progressions and virtuosic practices from 18th-century European models, especially Bach and Antonio Vivaldi, by influential guitarists such as Ritchie Blackmore, Marty Friedman, Jason Becker, Uli Jon Roth, Eddie Van Halen, Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen\\".
643	Kurt Bachmann of Believer has stated that \\"If done correctly, metal and classical fit quite well together.
644	Classical and metal are probably the two genres that have the most in common when it comes to feel, texture, creativity.\\"
645	Although a number of metal musicians cite classical composers as inspiration, classical and metal are rooted in different cultural traditions and practices—classical in the art music tradition, metal in the popular music tradition.
646	As musicologists Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note, \\"Analyses of popular music also sometimes reveal the influence of 'art traditions'.
647	An example is Walser's linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century Romanticism.
648	However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from \\"art music'.
649	\\"Lyrical themesAccording to scholars David Hatch and Stephen Millward, Black Sabbath, and the numerous heavy metal bands that they inspired, have concentrated lyrically \\"on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music\\".
650	They take as an example Sabbath's second album Paranoid (1970), which \\"included songs dealing with personal trauma—'Paranoid' and 'Fairies Wear Boots' (which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking)—as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory 'War Pigs' and 'Hand of Doom'.\\"
651	Deriving from the genre's roots in blues music, sex is another important topic—a thread running from Led Zeppelin's suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam metal and nu metal bands.
652	King Diamond, known for writing conceptual lyrics about horror stories.
653	The thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism.
654	According to Jon Pareles, \\"Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal.
655	With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates ... a party without limits ...
656	[T]he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic.\\"
657	Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny and the occult.
658	During the 1980s, the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs.
659	Andrew Cope states that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are \\"clearly misguided\\" as these critics have \\"overlook[ed] the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise\\".
660	Music critic Robert Christgau called metal \\"an expressive mode [that] it sometimes seems will be with us for as long as ordinary white boys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat\\".
661	Heavy metal artists have had to defend their lyrics in front of the U.S. Senate and in court.
662	In 1985, Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider was asked to defend his song \\"Under the Blade\\" at a U.S. Senate hearing.
663	At the hearing, the PMRC alleged that the song was about sadomasochism and rape; Snider stated that the song was about his bandmate's throat surgery.
664	In 1986, Ozzy Osbourne was sued over the lyrics of his song \\"Suicide Solution\\".
665	A lawsuit against Osbourne was filed by the parents of John McCollum, a depressed teenager who committed suicide allegedly after listening to Osbourne's song.
666	Osbourne was not found to be responsible for the teen's death.
667	In 1990, Judas Priest was sued in American court by the parents of two young men who had shot themselves five years earlier, allegedly after hearing the subliminal statement \\"do it\\" in the song Better by You, Better than Me, it was featured on the album Stained Class (1978), the song was also a Spooky Tooth cover.
668	While the case attracted a great deal of media attention, it was ultimately dismissed.
669	In 1991, UK police seized death metal records from the British record label Earache Records, in an \\"unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the label for obscenity\\".
670	In some predominantly Muslim countries, heavy metal has been officially denounced as a threat to traditional values.
671	In countries such as Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon, and Malaysia, there have been incidents of heavy metal musicians and fans being arrested and incarcerated.
672	In 1997, the Egyptian police jailed many young metal fans and they were accused of \\"devil worship\\" and blasphemy, after police found metal recordings during searches of their homes.
673	In 2013, Malaysia banned Lamb of God from performing in their country, on the grounds that the \\"band's lyrics could be interpreted as being religiously insensitive\\" and blasphemous.
674	Some people considered heavy metal music to being a leading factor for mental health disorders, and thought that heavy metal fans were more likely to suffer with a poor mental health, but study has proven that this is not true and the fans of this music have a lower or similar percentage of people suffering from poor mental health.
675	Image and fashionKiss performing in 2004, wearing makeup.
676	For many artists and bands, visual imagery plays a large role in heavy metal.
677	In addition to its sound and lyrics, a heavy metal band's image is expressed in album cover art, logos, stage sets, clothing, design of instruments, and music videos.
678	Down-the-back long hair is the \\"most crucial distinguishing feature of metal fashion\\".
679	Originally adopted from the hippie subculture, by the 1980s and 1990s heavy metal hair \\"symbolised the hate, angst and disenchantment of a generation that seemingly never felt at home\\", according to journalist Nader Rahman.
680	Long hair gave members of the metal community \\"the power they needed to rebel against nothing in general\\".
681	The classic uniform of heavy metal fans consists of light colored, ripped frayed or torn blue jeans, black T-shirts, boots, and black leather or denim jackets.
682	Deena Weinstein writes, \\"T-shirts are generally emblazoned with the logos or other visual representations of favorite metal bands.\\"
683	In the 1980s, a range of sources, from punk and goth music to horror films, influenced metal fashion.
684	Many metal performers of the 1970s and 1980s used radically shaped and brightly colored instruments to enhance their stage appearance.
685	Fashion and personal style was especially important for glam metal bands of the era.
686	Performers typically wore long, dyed, hairspray-teased hair (hence the nickname, \\"hair metal\\"); makeup such as lipstick and eyeliner; gaudy clothing, including leopard-skin-printed shirts or vests and tight denim, leather, or spandex pants; and accessories such as headbands and jewelry.
687	Pioneered by the heavy metal act X Japan in the late 1980s, bands in the Japanese movement known as visual kei—which includes many nonmetal groups—emphasize elaborate costumes, hair, and makeup.
688	Physical gestures Fans raise their fists and make the \\"devil horns\\" gesture at a Metsatöll concert.
689	Many metal musicians when performing live engage in headbanging, which involves rhythmically beating time with the head, often emphasized by long hair.
690	The il cornuto, or devil horns, hand gesture was popularized by vocalist Ronnie James Dio while with Black Sabbath and Dio.
691	Although Gene Simmons of Kiss claims to have been the first to make the gesture on the 1977 Love Gun album cover, there is speculation as to who started the phenomenon.
692	Attendees of metal concerts do not dance in the usual sense.
693	It has been argued that this is due to the music's largely male audience and \\"extreme heterosexualist ideology\\".
694	Two primary body movements used are headbanging and an arm thrust that is both a sign of appreciation and a rhythmic gesture.
695	The performance of air guitar is popular among metal fans both at concerts and listening to records at home.
696	According to Deena Weinstein, thrash metal concerts have two elements that are not part of the other metal genres: moshing and stage diving, which \\"were imported from the punk/hardcore subculture\\".
697	Weinstein states that moshing participants bump and jostle each other as they move in a circle in an area called the \\"pit\\" near the stage.
698	Stage divers climb onto the stage with the band and then jump \\"back into the audience\\".
699	Fan subcultureA heavy metal fan wearing a denim jacket with band patches and artwork of the heavy metal bands Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Iron Maiden, Slipknot, Dio and Led Zeppelin.
700	It has been argued that heavy metal has outlasted many other rock genres largely due to the emergence of an intense, exclusionary, strongly masculine subculture.
701	While the metal fan base is largely young, white, male, and blue-collar, the group is \\"tolerant of those outside its core demographic base who follow its codes of dress, appearance, and behavior\\".
702	Identification with the subculture is strengthened not only by the group experience of concert-going and shared elements of fashion, but also by contributing to metal magazines and, more recently, websites.
703	Attending live concerts in particular has been called the \\"holiest of heavy metal communions.
704	\\"The metal scene has been characterized as a \\"subculture of alienation\\", with its own code of authenticity.
705	This code puts several demands on performers: they must appear both completely devoted to their music and loyal to the subculture that supports it; they must appear uninterested in mainstream appeal and radio hits; and they must never \\"sell out\\".
706	Deena Weinstein states that for the fans themselves, the code promotes \\"opposition to established authority, and separateness from the rest of society\\".
707	Musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie observes, \\"Most of the kids who come to my shows seem like really imaginative kids with a lot of creative energy they don't know what to do with\\" and that metal is \\"outsider music for outsiders.
708	Nobody wants to be the weird kid; you just somehow end up being the weird kid.
709	It's kind of like that, but with metal you have all the weird kids in one place\\".
710	Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers (and some other fans) as \\"poseurs\\" \\"who pretended to be part of the subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity\\".
711	EtymologyThe origin of the term \\"heavy metal\\" in a musical context is uncertain.
712	The phrase has been used for centuries in chemistry and metallurgy, where the periodic table organizes elements of both light and heavy metals (e.g., uranium).
713	An early use of the term in modern popular culture was by countercultural writer William S. Burroughs.
714	His 1962 novel The Soft Machine includes a character known as \\"Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid\\".
715	Burroughs' next novel, Nova Express (1964), develops the theme, using heavy metal as a metaphor for addictive drugs: \\"With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms—Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes—And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music\\".
716	Inspired by Burroughs' novels, the term was used in the title of the 1967 album Featuring the Human Host and the Heavy Metal Kids by Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, which has been claimed to be its first use in the context of music.
717	The phrase was later lifted by Sandy Pearlman, who used the term to describe The Byrds for their supposed \\"aluminium style of context and effect\\", particularly on their album The Notorious Byrd Brothers (1968).
718	Metal historian Ian Christe describes what the components of the term mean in \\"hippiespeak\\": \\"heavy\\" is roughly synonymous with \\"potent\\" or \\"profound,\\" and \\"metal\\" designates a certain type of mood, grinding and weighted as with metal.
719	The word \\"heavy\\" in this sense was a basic element of beatnik and later countercultural hippie slang, and references to \\"heavy music\\"—typically slower, more amplified variations of standard pop fare—were already common by the mid-1960s, such as in reference to Vanilla Fudge.
720	Iron Butterfly's debut album, released in early 1968, was titled Heavy.
721	The first use of \\"heavy metal\\" in a song lyric is in reference to a motorcycle in the Steppenwolf song \\"Born to Be Wild\\", also released that year: \\"I like smoke and lightning/Heavy metal thunder/Racin' with the wind/
722	And the feelin' that I'm under.
723	\\"The first documented use of the phrase to describe a type of rock music identified to date appears in a review by Barry Gifford.
724	In the May 11, 1968, issue of Rolling Stone, he wrote about the album A Long Time Comin' by U.S. band Electric Flag: \\"Nobody who's been listening to Mike Bloomfield—either talking or playing—in the last few years could have expected this.
725	This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock.\\"
726	In January 1970 Lucian K. Truscott IV reviewing Led Zeppelin II for the Village Voice described the sound as \\"heavy\\" and made comparisons with Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge.
727	Other early documented uses of the phrase are from reviews by critic Mike Saunders.
728	In the November 12, 1970 issue of Rolling Stone, he commented on an album put out the previous year by the British band Humble Pie: \\"Safe as Yesterday Is, their first American release, proved that Humble Pie could be boring in lots of different ways.
729	Here they were a noisy, unmelodic, heavy metal-leaden shit-rock band with the loud and noisy parts beyond doubt.
730	There were a couple of nice songs ... and one monumental pile of refuse\\".
731	He described the band's latest, self-titled release as \\"more of the same 27th-rate heavy metal crap\\".
732	In a review of Sir Lord Baltimore's Kingdom Come in the May 1971 Creem, Saunders wrote, \\"Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best heavy metal tricks in the book\\".
733	Creem critic Lester Bangs is credited with popularizing the term via his early 1970s essays on bands such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.
734	Through the decade, heavy metal was used by certain critics as a virtually automatic putdown.
735	In 1979, lead New York Times popular music critic John Rockwell described what he called \\"heavy-metal rock\\" as \\"brutally aggressive music played mostly for minds clouded by drugs\\", and, in a different article, as \\"a crude exaggeration of rock basics that appeals to white teenagers\\".
736	Coined by Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward, \\"downer rock\\" was one of the earliest terms used to describe this style of music and was applied to acts such as Sabbath and Bloodrock.
737	Classic Rock magazine described the downer rock culture revolving around the use of Quaaludes and the drinking of wine.
738	Later the term would be replaced by \\"heavy metal\\".
739	Earlier on, as \\"heavy metal\\" emerged partially from the heavy psychedelic rock scene, also known as acid rock, \\"acid rock\\" was often used interchangeably with \\"heavy metal\\" and \\"hard rock\\".
740	Musicologist Steve Waksman stated that \\"the distinction between acid rock, hard rock, and heavy metal can at some point never be more than tenuous\\", while percussionist John Beck defined \\"acid rock\\" as synonymous with hard rock and heavy metal.
741	Apart from \\"acid rock\\", the terms \\"heavy metal\\" and \\"hard rock\\" have often been used interchangeably, particularly in discussing bands of the 1970s, a period when the terms were largely synonymous.
742	For example, the 1983 Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll includes this passage: \\"known for its aggressive blues-based hard-rock style, Aerosmith was the top American heavy-metal band of the mid-Seventies\\".
743	HistoryAntecedents: 1950s to late 1960sHeavy metal's quintessential guitar style, built around distortion-heavy riffs and power chords, traces its roots to early 1950s Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson, and particularly Pat Hare, who captured a \\"grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound\\" on records such as James Cotton's \\"Cotton Crop Blues \\" (1954);  the late 1950s instrumentals of Link Wray, particularly \\"Rumble\\" (1958); the early 1960s surf rock of Dick Dale, including \\"Let's Go Trippin'\\" (1961) and \\"Misirlou\\" (1962); and The Kingsmen's version of \\"Louie Louie\\" (1963) which made it a garage rock standard.
744	Cream performing on the Dutch television program Fanclub in 1968.
745	However, the genre's direct lineage begins in the mid-1960s.
746	American blues music was a major influence on the early British rockers of the era.
747	Bands like The Rolling Stones and The Yardbirds developed blues rock by recording covers of classic blues songs, often speeding up the tempos.
748	As they experimented with the music, the UK blues-based bands—and the U.S. acts they influenced in turn—developed what would become the hallmarks of heavy metal, in particular, the loud, distorted guitar sound.
749	The Kinks played a major role in popularising this sound with their 1964 hit \\"You Really Got Me\\".
750	In addition to The Kinks' Dave Davies, other guitarists such as The Who's Pete Townshend and The Yardbirds' Jeff Beck were experimenting with feedback.
751	Where the blues rock drumming style started out largely as simple shuffle beats on small kits, drummers began using a more muscular, complex, and amplified approach to match and be heard against the increasingly loud guitar.
752	Vocalists similarly modified their technique and increased their reliance on amplification, often becoming more stylized and dramatic.
753	In terms of sheer volume, especially in live performance, The Who's \\"bigger-louder-wall-of-Marshalls\\" approach was seminal.
754	The combination of blues rock with psychedelic rock and acid rock formed much of the original basis for heavy metal.
755	The variant or subgenre of psychedelic rock often known as \\"acid rock\\" was particularly influential on heavy metal; acid rock is often defined as a heavier, louder, or harder variant of psychedelic rock, or the more extreme side of the psychedelic rock genre, frequently containing a loud, improvised, and heavily distorted guitar-centered sound.
756	Acid rock has been described as psychedelic rock at its \\"rawest and most intense,\\" emphasizing the heavier qualities associated with both the positive and negative extremes of the psychedelic experience rather than only the idyllic side of psychedelia.
757	American acid rock garage bands such as the 13th Floor Elevators epitomized the frenetic, heavier, darker and more psychotic sound of acid rock, a sound characterized by droning guitar riffs, amplified feedback, and guitar distortion, while the 13th Floor Elevators' sound in particular featured yelping vocals and \\"occasionally demented\\" lyrics.
758	Frank Hoffman notes that: \\"Psychedelia was sometimes referred to as 'acid rock'.
759	The latter label was applied to a pounding, hard rock variant that evolved out of the mid-1960s garage-punk movement. ...
760	When rock began turning back to softer, roots-oriented sounds in late 1968, acid-rock bands mutated into heavy metal acts.
761	\\"One of the most influential bands in forging the merger of psychedelic rock and acid rock with the blues rock genre was the British power trio Cream, who derived a massive, heavy sound from unison riffing between guitarist Eric Clapton and bassist Jack Bruce, as well as Ginger Baker's double bass drumming.
762	Their first two LPs, Fresh Cream (1966) and Disraeli Gears (1967), are regarded as essential prototypes for the future style of heavy metal.
763	The Jimi Hendrix Experience's debut album, Are You Experienced (1967), was also highly influential.
764	Hendrix's virtuosic technique would be emulated by many metal guitarists and the album's most successful single, \\"Purple Haze\\", is identified by some as the first heavy metal hit.
765	Vanilla Fudge, whose first album also came out in 1967, has been called \\"one of the few American links between psychedelia and what soon became heavy metal\\", and the band has been cited as an early American heavy metal group.
766	On their self-titled debut album, Vanilla Fudge created \\"loud, heavy, slowed-down arrangements\\" of contemporary hit songs, blowing these songs up to \\"epic proportions\\" and \\"bathing them in a trippy, distorted haze.
767	\\"During the late 1960s, many psychedelic singers, such as Arthur Brown, began to create outlandish, theatrical and often macabre performances; which in itself became incredibly influential to many metal acts.
768	The American psychedelic rock band Coven, who opened for early heavy metal influencers such as Vanilla Fudge and the Yardbirds, portrayed themselves as practitioners of witchcraft or black magic, using dark—Satanic or occult—imagery in their lyrics, album art, and live performances.
769	Live shows consisted of elaborate, theatrical \\"Satanic rites.\\"
770	Coven's 1969 debut album, Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls, featured imagery of skulls, black masses, inverted crosses, and Satan worship, and both the album artwork and the band's live performances marked the first appearances in rock music of the sign of the horns, which would later become an important gesture in heavy metal culture.
771	At the same time in England, the band Black Widow were also among the first psychedelic rock bands to use occult and Satanic imagery and lyrics, though both Black Widow and Coven's lyrical and thematic influences on heavy metal were quickly overshadowed by the darker and heavier sounds of Black Sabbath.
772	Origins: late 1960s and early 1970sJohn Kay of Steppenwolf.
773	Critics disagree over who can be thought of as the first heavy metal band.
774	Most credit either Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath, with American commentators tending to favour Led Zeppelin and British commentators tending to favour Black Sabbath, though many give equal credit to both.
775	A few commentators—mainly American—argue for other groups including Iron Butterfly, Steppenwolf or Blue Cheer.
776	Deep Purple, the third band in what is sometimes considered the \\"unholy trinity\\" of heavy metal (Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple), despite being slightly older than Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, fluctuated between many rock styles until late 1969 when they took a heavy metal direction.
777	In 1968, the sound that would become known as heavy metal began to coalesce.
778	That January, the San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a cover of Eddie Cochran's classic \\"Summertime Blues\\", from their debut album Vincebus Eruptum, that many consider the first true heavy metal recording.
779	The same month, Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album, including \\"Born to Be Wild\\", which refers to \\"heavy metal thunder\\" in describing a motorcycle.
780	In July, the Jeff Beck Group, whose leader had preceded Page as The Yardbirds' guitarist, released its debut record: Truth featured some of the \\"most molten, barbed, downright funny noises of all time,\\" breaking ground for generations of metal ax-slingers.
781	In September, Page's new band, Led Zeppelin, made its live debut in Denmark (billed as The New Yardbirds).
782	The Beatles' White Album, released the following month, included \\"Helter Skelter\\", then one of the heaviest-sounding songs ever released by a major band.
783	The Pretty Things' rock opera S.F. Sorrow, released in December, featured \\"proto heavy metal\\" songs such as \\"Old Man Going\\" and \\"I See You\\".
784	Iron Butterfly's 1968 song  \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\" is sometimes described as an example of the transition between acid rock and heavy metal or the turning point in which acid rock became \\"heavy metal\\", and both Iron Butterfly's 1968 album In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida and Blue Cheer's 1968 album Vincebus Eruptum have been described as laying the foundation of heavy metal and greatly influential in the transformation of acid rock into heavy metal.
785	In this counterculture period MC5, who began as part of the Detroit garage rock scene, developed a raw distorted style that has been seen as a major influence on the future sound of both heavy metal and later punk music.
786	The Stooges also began to establish and influence a heavy metal and later punk sound, with songs such as \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\", featuring pounding and distorted heavy guitar power chord riffs.
787	Pink Floyd released two of their heaviest and loudest songs to date; \\"Ibiza Bar\\" and \\"The Nile Song\\", which was regarded as \\"one of the heaviest songs the band recorded\\".
788	King Crimson's debut album started with \\"21st Century Schizoid Man,\\" which was considered heavy metal by several critics.
789	In January 1969, Led Zeppelin's self-titled debut album was released and reached number 10 on the Billboard album chart.
790	In July, Zeppelin and a power trio with a Cream-inspired, but cruder sound, Grand Funk Railroad, played the Atlanta Pop Festival.
791	That same month, another Cream-rooted trio led by Leslie West released Mountain, an album filled with heavy blues rock guitar and roaring vocals.
792	In August, the group—now itself dubbed Mountain—played an hour-long set at the Woodstock Festival, exposing the crowd of 300,000 people to the emerging sound of heavy metal.
793	Mountain's proto-metal or early heavy metal hit song \\"Mississippi Queen\\" from the album Climbing! is especially credited with paving the way for heavy metal and was one of the first heavy guitar songs to receive regular play on radio.
794	In September 1969, the Beatles released the album Abbey Road containing the track \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" which has been credited as an early example of or influence on heavy metal or doom metal.
795	In October 1969, British band High Tide debuted with the heavy, proto-metal album Sea Shanties.
796	Led Zeppelin defined central aspects of the emerging genre, with Page's highly distorted guitar style and singer Robert Plant's dramatic, wailing vocals.
797	Other bands, with a more consistently heavy, \\"purely\\" metal sound, would prove equally important in codifying the genre.
798	The 1970 releases by Black Sabbath (Black Sabbath and Paranoid) and Deep Purple (In Rock) were crucial in this regard.
799	Birmingham's Black Sabbath had developed a particularly heavy sound in part due to an industrial accident guitarist Tony Iommi suffered before cofounding the band.
800	Unable to play normally, Iommi had to tune his guitar down for easier fretting and rely on power chords with their relatively simple fingering.
801	The bleak, industrial, working class environment of Birmingham, a manufacturing city full of noisy factories and metalworking, has itself been credited with influencing Black Sabbath's heavy, chugging, metallic sound and the sound of heavy metal in general.
802	Deep Purple had fluctuated between styles in its early years, but by 1969 vocalist Ian Gillan and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had led the band toward the developing heavy metal style.
803	In 1970, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple scored major UK chart hits with \\"Paranoid\\" and \\"Black Night\\", respectively.
804	That same year, two other British bands released debut albums in a heavy metal mode: Uriah Heep with ...Very 'Eavy ...Very 'Umble and UFO with UFO 1.
805	Bloodrock released their self-titled debut album, containing a collection of heavy guitar riffs, gruff style vocals and sadistic and macabre lyrics.
806	The influential Budgie brought the new metal sound into a power trio context, creating some of the heaviest music of the time.
807	The occult lyrics and imagery employed by Black Sabbath and Uriah Heep would prove particularly influential; Led Zeppelin also began foregrounding such elements with its fourth album, released in 1971.
808	In 1973, Deep Purple released the song \\"Smoke on the Water\\", with the iconic riff that's usually considered as the most recognizable one in \\"heavy rock\\" history, as a single of the classic live album Made in Japan.
809	Brian Robertson, Phil Lynott, Scott Gorham of Thin Lizzy performing during the Bad Reputation Tour, November 24, 1977.
810	On the other side of the Atlantic, the trend-setting group was Grand Funk Railroad, described as \\"the most commercially successful American heavy-metal band from 1970 until they disbanded in 1976, [they] established the Seventies success formula: continuous touring\\".
811	Other influential bands identified with metal emerged in the U.S., such as Sir Lord Baltimore (Kingdom Come, 1970), Blue Öyster Cult (Blue Öyster Cult, 1972), Aerosmith (Aerosmith, 1973) and Kiss (Kiss, 1974).
812	Sir Lord Baltimore's 1970 debut album and both Humble Pie's debut and self-titled third album were all among the first albums to be described in print as \\"heavy metal\\", with As Safe As Yesterday Is being referred to by the term \\"heavy metal\\" in a 1970 review in Rolling Stone magazine.
813	Various smaller bands from the U.S., U.K, and Continental Europe, including Bang, Josefus, Leaf Hound, Primeval, Hard Stuff,  Truth and Janey, Dust, JPT Scare Band, Frijid Pink, Cactus, May Blitz, Captain Beyond, Toad, Granicus, Iron Claw, and Yesterday's Children, though lesser known outside of their respective scenes, proved to be greatly influential on the emerging metal movement.
814	In Germany, Scorpions debuted with Lonesome Crow in 1972.
815	Blackmore, who had emerged as a virtuoso soloist with Deep Purple's highly influential album Machine Head (1972), left the band in 1975 to form Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio, singer and bassist for blues rock band Elf and future vocalist for Black Sabbath and heavy metal band Dio.
816	Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio would expand on the mystical and fantasy-based lyrics and themes sometimes found in heavy metal, pioneering both power metal and neoclassical metal.
817	These bands also built audiences via constant touring and increasingly elaborate stage shows.
818	As described above, there are arguments about whether these and other early bands truly qualify as \\"heavy metal\\" or simply as \\"hard rock\\".
819	Those closer to the music's blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label.
820	AC/DC, which debuted with High Voltage in 1975, is a prime example.
821	The 1983 Rolling Stone encyclopedia entry begins, \\"Australian heavy-metal band AC/DC\\".
822	Rock historian Clinton Walker writes, \\"Calling AC/DC a heavy metal band in the seventies was as inaccurate as it is today. ...
823	[They] were a rock 'n' roll band that just happened to be heavy enough for metal\\".
824	The issue is not only one of shifting definitions, but also a persistent distinction between musical style and audience identification: Ian Christe describes how the band \\"became the stepping-stone that led huge numbers of hard rock fans into heavy metal perdition\\".
825	In certain cases, there is little debate.
826	After Black Sabbath, the next major example is Britain's Judas Priest, which debuted with Rocka Rolla in 1974.
827	In Christe's description,Black Sabbath's audience was ... left to scavenge for sounds with similar impact.
828	By the mid-1970s, heavy metal aesthetic could be spotted, like a mythical beast, in the moody bass and complex dual guitars of Thin Lizzy, in the stagecraft of Alice Cooper, in the sizzling guitar and showy vocals of Queen, and in the thundering medieval questions of Rainbow. ...
829	Judas Priest arrived to unify and amplify these diverse highlights from hard rock's sonic palette.
830	For the first time, heavy metal became a true genre unto itself.
831	Though Judas Priest did not have a top 40 album in the United States until 1980, for many it was the definitive post-Sabbath heavy metal band; its twin-guitar attack, featuring rapid tempos and a non-bluesy, more cleanly metallic sound, was a major influence on later acts.
832	While heavy metal was growing in popularity, most critics were not enamored of the music.
833	Objections were raised to metal's adoption of visual spectacle and other trappings of commercial artifice, but the main offense was its perceived musical and lyrical vacuity: reviewing a Black Sabbath album in the early 1970s, leading critic Robert Christgau described it as \\"dull and decadent ...
834	dim-witted, amoral exploitation.
835	\\"Mainstream: late 1970s and 1980sIron Maiden, one of the central bands in the new wave of British heavy metal.
836	Punk rock emerged in the mid-1970s as a reaction against contemporary social conditions as well as what was perceived as the overindulgent, overproduced rock music of the time, including heavy metal.
837	Sales of heavy metal records declined sharply in the late 1970s in the face of punk, disco, and more mainstream rock.
838	With the major labels fixated on punk, many newer British heavy metal bands were inspired by the movement's aggressive, high-energy sound and \\"lo-fi\\", do it yourself ethos.
839	Underground metal bands began putting out cheaply recorded releases independently to small, devoted audiences.
840	Motörhead, founded in 1975, was the first important band to straddle the punk/metal divide.
841	With the explosion of punk in 1977, others followed.
842	British music papers such as the NME and Sounds took notice, with Sounds writer Geoff Barton christening the movement the \\"New Wave of British Heavy Metal\\".
843	NWOBHM bands including Iron Maiden, Saxon, and Def Leppard re-energized the heavy metal genre.
844	Following the lead set by Judas Priest and Motörhead, they toughened up the sound, reduced its blues elements, and emphasized increasingly fast tempos.
845	By 1980, the NWOBHM had broken into the mainstream, as albums by Iron Maiden and Saxon, as well as Motörhead, reached the British top 10.
846	Though less commercially successful, other NWOBHM bands such as Venom and Diamond Head would have a significant influence on metal's development.
847	In 1981, Motörhead became the first of this new breed of metal bands to top the UK charts with the live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith.
848	The first generation of metal bands was ceding the limelight.
849	Deep Purple had broken up soon after Blackmore's departure in 1975, and Led Zeppelin broke up following drummer John Bonham's death in 1980.
850	Black Sabbath plagued with infighting and substance abuse, while facing fierce competition with their opening band, the Los Angeles band Van Halen.
851	Eddie Van Halen established himself as one of the leading metal guitarists of the era.
852	His solo on \\"Eruption\\", from the band's self-titled 1978 album, is considered a milestone.
853	 Eddie Van Halen's sound even crossed over into pop music when his guitar solo was featured on the track \\"Beat It\\" by Michael Jackson (a U.S. number 1 in February 1983).
854	Inspired by Van Halen's success, a metal scene began to develop in Southern California during the late 1970s.
855	Based on the clubs of L.A.'s Sunset Strip, bands such as Quiet Riot, Ratt, Mötley Crüe, and W.A.S.P. were influenced by traditional heavy metal of the earlier 1970s.
856	These acts incorporated the theatrics (and sometimes makeup) of glam metal or \\"hair metal\\" such as Alice Cooper and Kiss.
857	Glam metal bands were often visually distinguished by long, overworked hair styles accompanied by wardrobes which were sometimes considered cross-gender.
858	The lyrics of these glam metal bands characteristically emphasized hedonism and wild behavior, including lyrics which involved sexual expletives and the use of narcotics.
859	In the wake of the new wave of British heavy metal and Judas Priest's breakthrough British Steel (1980), heavy metal became increasingly popular in the early 1980s.
860	Many metal artists benefited from the exposure they received on MTV, which began airing in 1981—sales often soared if a band's videos screened on the channel.
861	Def Leppard's videos for Pyromania (1983) made them superstars in America and Quiet Riot became the first domestic heavy metal band to top the Billboard chart with Metal Health (1983).
862	One of the seminal events in metal's growing popularity was the 1983 US Festival in California, where the \\"heavy metal day\\" featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Scorpions, Mötley Crüe, Judas Priest, and others drew the largest audiences of the three-day event.
863	Between 1983 and 1984, heavy metal went from an 8 percent to a 20 percent share of all recordings sold in the U.S.
864	Several major professional magazines devoted to the genre were launched, including Kerrang!
865	(in 1981) and Metal Hammer (in 1984), as well as a host of fan journals.
866	In 1985, Billboard declared, \\"Metal has broadened its audience base.
867	Metal music is no longer the exclusive domain of male teenagers.
868	The metal audience has become older (college-aged), younger (pre-teen), and more female\\".
869	By the mid-1980s, glam metal was a dominant presence on the U.S. charts, music television, and the arena concert circuit.
870	New bands such as L.A.'s Warrant and acts from the East Coast like Poison and Cinderella became major draws, while Mötley Crüe and Ratt remained very popular.
871	Bridging the stylistic gap between hard rock and glam metal, New Jersey's Bon Jovi became enormously successful with its third album, Slippery When Wet (1986).
872	The similarly styled Swedish band Europe became international stars with The Final Countdown (1986).
873	Its title track hit number 1 in 25 countries.
874	In 1987, MTV launched a show, Headbanger's Ball, devoted exclusively to heavy metal videos.
875	However, the metal audience had begun to factionalize, with those in many underground metal scenes favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular style as \\"light metal\\" or \\"hair metal\\".
876	One band that reached diverse audiences was Guns N' Roses.
877	In contrast to their glam metal contemporaries in L.A., they were seen as much more raw and dangerous.
878	With the release of their chart-topping Appetite for Destruction (1987), they \\"recharged and almost single-handedly sustained the Sunset Strip sleaze system for several years\\".
879	The following year, Jane's Addiction emerged from the same L.A. hard-rock club scene with its major label debut, Nothing's Shocking.
880	Reviewing the album, Rolling Stone declared, \\"as much as any band in existence, Jane's Addiction is the true heir to Led Zeppelin\\".
881	The group was one of the first to be identified with the \\"alternative metal\\" trend that would come to the fore in the next decade.
882	Meanwhile, new bands such as New York's Winger and New Jersey's Skid Row sustained the popularity of the glam metal style.
883	Other heavy metal genres: 1980s, 1990s, and 2000sDrummer Eric Moore from crossover thrash band Suicidal Tendencies.
884	Many subgenres of heavy metal developed outside of the commercial mainstream during the 1980s such as crossover thrash.
885	Several attempts have been made to map the complex world of underground metal, most notably by the editors of AllMusic, as well as critic Garry Sharpe-Young.
886	Sharpe-Young's multivolume metal encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories: thrash metal, death metal, black metal, power metal, and the related subgenres of doom and gothic metal.
887	In 1990, a review in Rolling Stone suggested retiring the term \\"heavy metal\\" as the genre was \\"ridiculously vague\\".
888	The article stated that the term only fueled \\"misperceptions of rock & roll bigots who still assume that five bands as different as Ratt, Extreme, Anthrax, Danzig and Mother Love Bone\\" sound the same.
889	Thrash metalThrash metal band Slayer performing in 2007 in front of a wall of speaker stacks.
890	Thrash metal emerged in the early 1980s under the influence of hardcore punk and the new wave of British heavy metal, particularly songs in the revved-up style known as speed metal.
891	The movement began in the United States, with Bay Area thrash metal being the leading scene.
892	The sound developed by thrash groups was faster and more aggressive than that of the original metal bands and their glam metal successors.
893	Low-register guitar riffs are typically overlaid with shredding leads.
894	Lyrics often express nihilistic views or deal with social issues using visceral, gory language.
895	Thrash has been described as a form of \\"urban blight music\\" and \\"a palefaced cousin of rap\\".
896	The subgenre was popularized by the \\"Big Four of Thrash\\": Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer.
897	Three German bands, Kreator, Sodom, and Destruction, played a central role in bringing the style to Europe.
898	Others, including San Francisco Bay Area's Testament and Exodus, New Jersey's Overkill, and Brazil's Sepultura and Sarcófago, also had a significant impact.
899	Although thrash began as an underground movement, and remained largely that for almost a decade, the leading bands of the scene began to reach a wider audience.
900	Metallica brought the sound into the top 40 of the Billboard album chart in 1986 with Master of Puppets, the genre's first platinum record.
901	Two years later, the band's ...And Justice for All hit number 6, while Megadeth and Anthrax also had top 40 records on the American charts.
902	Though less commercially successful than the rest of the Big Four, Slayer released one of the genre's definitive records: Reign in Blood (1986) was credited for incorporating heavier guitar timbres, and for including explicit depictions of death, suffering, violence and occult into thrash metal's lyricism.
903	Slayer attracted a following among far-right skinheads, and accusations of promoting violence and Nazi themes have dogged the band.
904	Even though Slayer did not receive substantial media exposure, their music played a key role in the development of extreme metal.
905	In the early 1990s, thrash achieved breakout success, challenging and redefining the metal mainstream.
906	Metallica's self-titled 1991 album topped the Billboard chart, as the band established international following.
907	Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction (1992) debuted at number two, Anthrax and Slayer cracked the top 10, and albums by regional bands such as Testament and Sepultura entered the top 100.
908	Death metalDeath's Chuck Schuldiner, \\"widely recognized as the father of death metal\\".
909	Thrash soon began to evolve and split into more extreme metal genres.
910	\\"Slayer's music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal,\\" according to MTV News.
911	The NWOBHM band Venom was also an important progenitor.
912	The death metal movement in both North America and Europe adopted and emphasized the elements of blasphemy and diabolism employed by such acts.
913	Florida's Death, San Francisco Bay Area's Possessed, and Ohio's Necrophagia are recognized as seminal bands in the style.
914	Both groups have been credited with inspiring the subgenre's name, the latter via its 1984 demo Death Metal and the song \\"Death Metal\\", from its 1985 debut album Seven Churches (1985).
915	In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Swedish death metal became notable and melodic forms of death metal were created.
916	Death metal utilizes the speed and aggression of both thrash and hardcore, fused with lyrics preoccupied with Z-grade slasher movie violence and Satanism.
917	Death metal vocals are typically bleak, involving guttural \\"death growls\\", high-pitched screaming, the \\"death rasp\\", and other uncommon techniques.
918	Complementing the deep, aggressive vocal style are downtuned, heavily distorted guitars and extremely fast percussion, often with rapid double bass drumming and \\"wall of sound\\"–style blast beats.
919	Frequent tempo and time signature changes and syncopation are also typical.
920	Death metal, like thrash metal, generally rejects the theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets.
921	One major exception to this rule was Deicide's Glen Benton, who branded an inverted cross on his forehead and wore armor on stage.
922	Morbid Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery.
923	These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s.
924	In the UK, the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged from the anarcho-punk movement.
925	Black metalThe first wave of black metal emerged in Europe in the early and mid-1980s, led by the United Kingdom's Venom, Denmark's Mercyful Fate, Switzerland's Hellhammer and Celtic Frost, and Sweden's Bathory.
926	By the late 1980s, Norwegian bands such as Mayhem and Burzum were heading a second wave.
927	Black metal varies considerably in style and production quality, although most bands emphasize shrieked and growled vocals, highly distorted guitars frequently played with rapid tremolo picking, a dark atmosphere and intentionally lo-fi production, with ambient noise and background hiss.
928	Satanic themes are common in black metal, though many bands take inspiration from ancient paganism, promoting a return to supposed pre-Christian values.
929	Numerous black metal bands also \\"experiment with sounds from all possible forms of metal, folk, classical music, electronica and avant-garde\\".
930	Darkthrone drummer Fenriz explains, \\"It had something to do with production, lyrics, the way they dressed and a commitment to making ugly, raw, grim stuff.
931	There wasn't a generic sound.
932	\\"Although bands such as Sarcófago had been donning corpsepaint, by 1990, Mayhem was regularly wearing corpsepaint; many other black metal acts also adopted the look.
933	Bathory inspired the Viking metal and folk metal movements and Immortal brought blast beats to the fore.
934	Some bands in the Scandinavian black metal scene became associated with considerable violence in the early 1990s, with Mayhem and Burzum linked to church burnings.
935	Growing commercial hype around death metal generated a backlash; beginning in Norway, much of the Scandinavian metal underground shifted to support a black metal scene that resisted being co-opted by the commercial metal industry.
936	By 1992, black metal scenes had begun to emerge in areas outside Scandinavia, including Germany, France, and Poland.
937	The 1993 murder of Mayhem's Euronymous by Burzum's Varg Vikernes provoked intensive media coverage.
938	Around 1996, when many in the scene felt the genre was stagnating, several key bands, including Burzum and Finland's Beherit, moved toward an ambient style, while symphonic black metal was explored by Sweden's Tiamat and Switzerland's Samael.
939	In the late 1990s and early 2000s decade, Norway's Dimmu Borgir brought black metal closer to the mainstream, as did Cradle of Filth.
940	Power metalSwedish power metal band HammerFall after a concert in Milan, Italy, in 2005.
941	Italian band Rhapsody of Fire performing in Buenos Aires in 2010.
942	During the late 1980s, the power metal scene came together largely in reaction to the harshness of death and black metal.
943	Though a relatively underground style in North America, it enjoys wide popularity in Europe, Japan, and South America.
944	Power metal focuses on upbeat, epic melodies and themes that \\"appeal to the listener's sense of valor and loveliness\\".
945	The prototype for the sound was established in the mid-to-late 1980s by Germany's Helloween, which combined the power riffs, melodic approach, and high-pitched, \\"clean\\" singing style of bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden with thrash's speed and energy, \\"crystalliz[ing] the sonic ingredients of what is now known as power metal\\".
946	Traditional power metal bands like Sweden's HammerFall, England's DragonForce, and America's Iced Earth have a sound clearly indebted to the classic NWOBHM style.
947	Many power metal bands such as America's Kamelot, Finnish groups Nightwish, Stratovarius and Sonata Arctica, Italy's Rhapsody of Fire, and Russia's Catharsis feature a keyboard-based \\"symphonic\\" sound, sometimes employing orchestras and opera singers.
948	Power metal has built a strong fanbase in Japan and South America, where bands like Brazil's Angra and Argentina's Rata Blanca are popular.
949	Closely related to power metal is progressive metal, which adopts the complex compositional approach of bands like Rush and King Crimson.
950	This style emerged in the United States in the early and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Dream Theater.
951	The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo is among the most recognized of latter-day shredders.
952	Doom metalEmerging in the mid-1980s with such bands as California's Saint Vitus, Maryland's The Obsessed, Chicago's Trouble, and Sweden's Candlemass, the doom metal movement rejected other metal styles' emphasis on speed, slowing its music to a crawl.
953	Doom metal traces its roots to the lyrical themes and musical approach of early Black Sabbath.
954	The Melvins have also been a significant influence on doom metal and a number of its subgenres.
955	Doom emphasizes melody, melancholy tempos, and a sepulchral mood relative to many other varieties of metal.
956	The 1991 release of Forest of Equilibrium, the debut album by UK band Cathedral, helped spark a new wave of doom metal.
957	During the same period, the doom-death fusion style of British bands Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, and Anathema gave rise to European gothic metal, with its signature dual-vocalist arrangements, exemplified by Norway's Theatre of Tragedy and Tristania.
958	New York's Type O Negative introduced an American take on the style.
959	In the United States, sludge metal, mixing doom and hardcore, emerged in the late 1980s—Eyehategod and Crowbar were leaders in a major Louisiana sludge scene.
960	Early in the next decade, California's Kyuss and Sleep, inspired by the earlier doom metal bands, spearheaded the rise of stoner metal, while Seattle's Earth helped develop the drone metal subgenre.
961	The late 1990s saw new bands form such as the Los Angeles–based Goatsnake, with a classic stoner/doom sound, and Sunn O))), which crosses lines between doom, drone, and dark ambient metal—the New York Times has compared their sound to an \\"Indian raga in the middle of an earthquake\\".
962	1990s and early 2000s subgenres and fusionsItalian band Lacuna Coil, one of the most successful gothic metal groups.
963	The era of heavy metal's mainstream dominance in North America came to an end in the early 1990s with the emergence of Nirvana and other grunge bands, signaling the popular breakthrough of alternative rock.
964	Grunge acts were influenced by the heavy metal sound, but rejected the excesses of the more popular metal bands, such as their \\"flashy and virtuosic solos\\" and \\"appearance-driven\\" MTV orientation.
965	Glam metal fell out of favor due not only to the success of grunge, but also because of the growing popularity of the more aggressive sound typified by Metallica and the post-thrash groove metal of Pantera and White Zombie.
966	In 1991, the band Metallica released their album Metallica, also known as The Black Album, which moved the band's sound out of the thrash metal genre and into standard heavy metal.
967	The album was certified 16× Platinum by the RIAA.
968	A few new, unambiguously metal bands had commercial success during the first half of the decade—Pantera's Far Beyond Driven topped the Billboard chart in 1994—but, \\"In the dull eyes of the mainstream, metal was dead\\".
969	Some bands tried to adapt to the new musical landscape.
970	Metallica revamped its image: the band members cut their hair and, in 1996, headlined the alternative musical festival Lollapalooza founded by Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell.
971	While this prompted a backlash among some long-time fans, Metallica remained one of the most successful bands in the world into the new century.
972	Layne Staley of Alice in Chains, one of the most popular acts identified with alternative metal performing in 1992.
973	Like Jane's Addiction, many of the most popular early 1990s groups with roots in heavy metal fall under the umbrella term \\"alternative metal\\".
974	Bands in Seattle's grunge scene such as Soundgarden, credited as making a \\"place for heavy metal in alternative rock\\", and Alice in Chains were at the center of the alternative metal movement.
975	The label was applied to a wide spectrum of other acts that fused metal with different styles: Faith No More combined their alternative rock sound with punk, funk, metal, and hip hop; Primus joined elements of funk, punk, thrash metal, and experimental music; Tool mixed metal and progressive rock; bands such as Fear Factory, Ministry and Nine Inch Nails began incorporating metal into their industrial sound, and vice versa, respectively; and Marilyn Manson went down a similar route, while also employing shock effects of the sort popularized by Alice Cooper.
976	Alternative metal artists, though they did not represent a cohesive scene, were united by their willingness to experiment with the metal genre and their rejection of glam metal aesthetics (with the stagecraft of Marilyn Manson and White Zombie—also identified with alt-metal—significant, if partial, exceptions).
977	Alternative metal's mix of styles and sounds represented \\"the colorful results of metal opening up to face the outside world.
978	\\"In the mid- and late 1990s came a new wave of U.S. metal groups inspired by the alternative metal bands and their mix of genres.
979	Dubbed \\"nu metal\\", bands such as Slipknot, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, P.O.D., Korn and Disturbed incorporated elements ranging from death metal to hip hop, often including DJs and rap-style vocals.
980	The mix demonstrated that \\"pancultural metal could pay off\\".
981	Nu metal gained mainstream success through heavy MTV rotation and Ozzy Osbourne's 1996 introduction of Ozzfest, which led the media to talk of a resurgence of heavy metal.
982	In 1999, Billboard noted that there were more than 500 specialty metal radio shows in the United States, nearly three times as many as ten years before.
983	While nu metal was widely popular, traditional metal fans did not fully embrace the style.
984	By early 2003, the movement's popularity was on the wane, though several nu metal acts such as Korn or Limp Bizkit retained substantial followings.
985	Recent styles: mid–late 2000s and 2010sMetalcore, a hybrid of extreme metal and hardcore punk, emerged as a commercial force in the mid-2000s decade.
986	Through the 1980s and 1990s, metalcore was mostly an underground phenomenon; pioneering bands include Earth Crisis, other prominent bands include Converge, Hatebreed and Shai Hulud.
987	By 2004, melodic metalcore—influenced as well by melodic death metal—was popular enough that Killswitch Engage's The End of Heartache and Shadows Fall's The War Within debuted at numbers 21 and 20, respectively, on the Billboard album chart.
988	Children of Bodom, performing at the 2007 Masters of Rock festival.
989	Evolving even further from metalcore comes mathcore, a more rhythmically complicated and progressive style brought to light by bands such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, and Protest the Hero.
990	Mathcore's main defining quality is the use of odd time signatures, and has been described to possess rhythmic comparability to free jazz.
991	Heavy metal remained popular in the 2000s, particularly in continental Europe.
992	By the new millennium Scandinavia had emerged as one of the areas producing innovative and successful bands, while Belgium, The Netherlands and especially Germany were the most significant markets.
993	Metal music is more favorably embraced in Scandinavia and Northern Europe than other regions due to social and political openness in these regions.
994	Established continental metal bands that placed multiple albums in the top 20 of the German charts between 2003 and 2008, including Finnish band Children of Bodom, Norwegian act Dimmu Borgir, Germany's Blind Guardian and Sweden's HammerFall.
995	In the 2000s, an extreme metal fusion genre known as deathcore emerged.
996	Deathcore incorporates elements of death metal, hardcore punk and metalcore.
997	Deathcore features characteristics such as death metal riffs, hardcore punk breakdowns, death growling, \\"pig squeal\\"-sounding vocals, and screaming.
998	Deathcore bands include Whitechapel, Suicide Silence, Despised Icon and Carnifex.
999	The term \\"retro-metal\\" has been used to describe bands such as Texas-based The Sword, California's High on Fire, Sweden's Witchcraft, and Australia's Wolfmother.
1000	The Sword's Age of Winters (2006) drew heavily on the work of Black Sabbath and Pentagram, Witchcraft added elements of folk rock and psychedelic rock, and Wolfmother's self-titled 2005 debut album had \\"Deep Purple-ish organs\\" and \\"Jimmy Page-worthy chordal riffing\\".
1001	Mastodon, which plays in a progressive/sludge style, has inspired claims of a metal revival in the United States, dubbed by some critics the \\"New Wave of American Heavy Metal\\".
1002	By the early 2010s, metalcore was evolving to more frequently incorporate synthesizers and elements from genres beyond rock and metal.
1003	The album Reckless & Relentless by British band Asking Alexandria (which sold 31,000 copies in its first week), and The Devil Wears Prada's 2011 album Dead Throne (which sold 32,400 in its first week) reached up to number 9 and 10, respectively, on the Billboard 200 chart.
1004	In 2013, British band Bring Me the Horizon released their fourth studio album Sempiternal to critical acclaim.
1005	The album debuted at number 3 on the UK Album Chart and at number 1 in Australia.
1006	The album sold 27,522 copies in the US, and charted at number 11 on the US Billboard Chart, making it their highest charting release in America until their follow-up album That's the Spirit debuted at no. 2 in 2015.
1007	Also in the 2010s, a metal style called \\"djent\\" developed as a spinoff of standard progressive metal.
1008	Djent music uses rhythmic and technical complexity, heavily distorted, palm-muted guitar chords, syncopated riffs and polyrhythms alongside virtuoso soloing.
1009	Another typical characteristic is the use of extended range seven, eight, and nine-string guitars.
1010	Djent bands include Periphery, Tesseract and Textures.
1011	Sharon Osbourne would become the manager for several bands, but is most remembered for her work with Ozzy Osbourne and Motörhead.
1012	Lzzy Hale of Halestorm.
1013	Women in heavy metalThe history of women in heavy metal can be traced back as far as the 1970s when the band Vixen was formed in 1973.
1014	Another hard rock band that featured all-female members, The Runaways, would be founded in 1975.
1015	And while The Runaways may have been lost to time, two former members would rise to fame in solo careers.
1016	Those being Joan Jett and Lita Ford, who would have successful rock careers.
1017	In 1978, with the rise of the new wave of British heavy metal, the band Girlschool would be founded, who are best known for their collaboration with Motörhead in 1980 under the pseudonym Headgirl.
1018	In 1996, Finnish band Nightwish was founded and has featured women as vocalists.
1019	This would lead to more women fronting heavy metal bands such as Halestorm, Within Temptation, Arch Enemy, and Epica among others.
1020	Women have had an important role behind the scenes, such as Gaby Hoffmann and Sharon Osbourne.
1021	In 1981, Hoffmann would help Don Dokken acquire his first record deal.
1022	Hoffmann also became the manager of Accept in 1981 and wrote songs under the pseudonym of \\"Deaffy\\" for many of band's studio albums.
1023	In the band's newer albums, vocalist Mark Tornillo stated that Hoffmann still had some influence in songwriting.
1024	Osbourne, the wife and manager of Ozzy Osbourne, would found the Ozzfest music festival and manage several bands, included Motörhead, Coal Chamber, The Smashing Pumpkins, Electric Light Orchestra, Lita Ford and Queen.

1168	The live version of \\"Hooks in You\\" was recorded at the Wembley Arena, London, UK on 17 December 1990.

1267	In the special features to the DVD of the film, Dunn attempted a restitution to the concerns of the black metal fans by including an additional featurette.

1269	DeathgasmDeathgasm-poster.jpgJason Lei HowdenJason Lei HowdenSimon RabyJeff HurrellDark Sky Films (US)86 minutesNew ZealandEnglishDeathgasm is a 2015 New Zealand comedy horror film written and directed by Jason Lei Howden in his directorial debut.
1270	The film premiered on 14 March 2015 at South by Southwest and was released in theaters later that year to positive reviews.
1271	PlotLong after the death of his father, Brodie's mother is institutionalized at a mental hospital.
1272	The teenager is thus obliged to move into his uncle's place in Greypoint.
1273	Brodie is a heavy metal fan, which conflicts with Uncle Albert's fundamentalist Christian beliefs.
1274	His fellow high school students regard him as an outcast, which leads to bullying from other boys (including his cousin, David).
1275	Brodie's only friends are two \\"geeks\\" named Dion and Giles, both of whom spend most of their time playing role playing games.
1276	Brodie soon becomes acquainted with another heavy metal fan, Zakk, at a local record store.
1277	Shortly after, Zakk, Brodie, Dion, and Giles form a metal band called 'DEATHGASM'.
1278	To Brodie's surprise, the beautiful Medina appears to be interested in him and invites him to have ice cream with her.
1279	However, Brodie is too shy and misses the chance to kiss Medina by the end of the date.
1280	Later, Zakk tells Brodie about the metal musician Rikki Daggers, who is allegedly living nearby.
1281	Zakk convinces Brodie to accompany him to an abandoned house, where he suspects Daggers to be hiding.
1282	After breaking in, they find Daggers sleeping inside, holding a record album.
1283	When Brodie and Zakk try to steal the album, Daggers wakes up and attacks.
1284	When he hears a noise in his house, he hands them the record and tells them to run away.
1285	Moments after Zakk and Brodie have left, a well-dressed man named Vadin enters the house and kills Daggers.
1286	He appears to be part of a cult which is looking for \\"The Black Hymn,\\" medieval sheet music with the power to summon demons.
1287	Since Vadin failed to obtain the sheets of music, the cult's leader, Aeon, later has him beheaded.
1288	At home, Brodie notices the sheets of music hidden inside of the record's cover.
1289	The band plays the song, as lights flicker in response.
1290	Brodie's Uncle Albert, who is outside, hyperventilates and starts to bleed from his eyes.
1291	Brodie senses that something is wrong, and abruptly stops playing his guitar before they manage to complete the hymn.
1292	The next day in school, Brodie translates the Latin writing on the old sheets of music.
1293	He finds out it reads: \\"The black hymn.
1294	Play it to invoke the demon.\\"
1295	On the way home, Brodie's cousin David lies in wait for him and beats him up violently to make him stay away from Medina, in whom he is also interested.
1296	In the meanwhile, Medina meets Zakk by chance.
1297	She tells him that she could not find Brodie and asks him to give him a note.
1298	Zakk reads the note and finds out Medina wants to meet Brodie at the local park in the late evening.
1299	He does not pass it on to Brodie, but goes there himself and lies to Medina that Brodie does not want to see her.
1300	Then he puts his jacket around her shoulders and they kiss.
1301	Brodie suspects that playing the Black Hymn is somehow connected to dark forces.
1302	Due to the humiliation by David and his friend, he wants to take possession of these powers to take revenge and therefore calls the band together to play the hymn.
1303	After having played it, the stereo equipment explodes and all band members fall unconscious.
1304	After waking up, all four notice that something has changed.
1305	Brodie meets Terry, a strange and frightening being in the school's toilet, who threatens him.
1306	Soon after the encounter with Terry, Mr. Cappenhurst starts to bleed from his body's orifices and throws up blood on a student during a lesson.
1307	In the evening, Brodie meets Zakk in a repair shop to tell him what happened where they are attacked by Zakk's father.
1308	The latter acts as if possessed, tears out his own eyes and then tries to kill them, but the two manage to defend themselves and kill him.
1309	Meanwhile, Dion and Giles also are attacked and nearly killed by a possessed, but Medina manages to save them by killing the possessed man using an axe.
1310	They decide to hide in the school's panic room and leave a note on Brodie's door to inform him about their whereabouts.
1311	Trying to find out what is happening, Zakk and Brodie meets with Abigail, a fortune teller.
1312	She tells them they have invoked the demon Aeloth \\"The Blind One\\" by playing the hymn, and that the residents of town are now possessed by Aeloth's minions, which kill every human being in order to prepare Aeloth's arrival.
1313	By 3 AM, Aeloth will merge with the most evil human being present.
1314	Before she is able to tell them how to undo Aeloth's summoning, she is killed by two of the possessed.
1315	Zakk is not interested in fighting Aeloth any further and decides to watch the town's doom from a nearby hill, but Brodie manages to convince him to help because he assumes the summoning will be undone by playing the Black Hymn backwards.
1316	They drive to Brodie's house to obtain the sheets of music.
1317	However, Zakk secretly removes the note stuck to the door by Dion, Giles and Medina and the sheets of music are blown out of the window by the wind.
1318	Suddenly, they are attacked by Brodie's uncle Albert and his wife Mary who have also been possessed, but manage to kill them using three dildos and a chainsaw.
1319	In contrast to his parents, Brodie's cousin David has not transformed yet, but Brodie decapitates David anyway as he enters the room.
1320	Having decided they will search the sheets of paper, Zakk and Brodie craft a few weapons and go after them.
1321	In the meantime, the members of the cult have come to Greypoint to serve Aeloth.
1322	They meet with Terry who appears to be Aeloth's ambassador.
1323	Terry promises Aeon that Aeloth will merge with him.
1324	In this moment, Aeson is killed by his acolyte Shanna, who then claims the lead of the cult.
1325	After having found all the sheets of notes, Zakk and Brodie go to the school building since they know there are amplifiers which allow them to play the hymn backwards.
1326	There, they meet Dion, Giles and Medina.
1327	As Brodie notices Zakk's jacket in Medina's bag, Zakk's lie is revealed.
1328	Brodied is hurt and angered by Zakk's betrayal, and Zakk tells Brodie he is not interested in Medina but simply wanted to have some fun to which Brodie responds with a punch to Zakk's face.
1329	A fight ensues between the two, which Zakk manages to win.
1330	He then decides to leave town.
1331	Reasoning that they can stop the evil by playing the music backwards, and that they must play loud enough for the entire town to hear, Brodie and the others go to Rikki Daggers’ house to use Rikki’s amplifiers.
1332	There, Shanna and the cult confront the teens.
1333	Shanna takes Medina hostage, forcing Brodie to turn over the music pages in an exchange.
1334	Shanna tears up the sheets and takes everyone prisoner.
1335	However, Zakk feels remorse for his friends and returns to them.
1336	He manages to free them and they attack the cult during their ritual for Aeloth.
1337	Brodie starts to play the Black Hymn backwards while the others defend him from the attacks by the cult members.
1338	In this fight, most of the cult members as well as Dion and Giles are killed.
1339	Brodie does not manage to play the hymn entirely before 3 AM, so Aeloth is able to enter Shanna's body.
1340	Zakk then kills her, but since he is the most evil person amongst the remaining, Aeloth then takes possession of his body.
1341	Brodie realizes it's too late to complete the hymn, so instead he just plays heavy metal straight from his heart.
1342	The power of the music causes Zakk to collapse and temporarily transform back into his human body, but the respite is brief as Zakk can feel the demon trying to regain control.
1343	 Zakk then urges Brodie to kill him in order to prevent the demon's resurrection, which Brodie eventually does.
1344	A few months later, Brodie and Medina are a happy Death Metal couple in Greypoint.
1345	Brodie puts on a record and Zakk's spirit plays a prank to make it look like Aeloth is returning.
1346	In a post-credits scene, Brodie and Zakk (who is speaking through the record player) have a conversation about what hell is like.

1348	The film won the 2013 Make My Horror Movie contest and received a NZ$200,000 prize to go toward production, which took place in mid-2014.
1349	 Executive producer Ant Timpson cited Howden's \\"sheer enthusiasm and utter commitment\\" as to why it won.
1350	ReceptionRotten Tomatoes reports that 88% of 25 critics gave the film a positive notice; the average rating is 6.4/10.
1351	The site's consensus states: \\"Deathgasm plumbs the blood-spattered depths of grindhouse gore with enough giddy glee to satisfy genre enthusiasts looking for a thrill.\\"
1352	On Metacritic, the film has a 65 out of 100 rating, based on 10 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".
1353	Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote that the script does not live up the vivid splatter effects, but the film's \\"consistent if undiscriminating high energy engenders a certain persuasive goodwill\\".
1354	Richard Whittaker of The Austin Chronicle wrote, \\"Shamelessly low-brow, reaching a beer-fueled gleeful high with a zombie-vs.-sex toys battle, it's a very metal tribute to the grand tradition of Kiwi splatter comedies.\\"
1355	Matt Donato of We Got This Covered rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \\"Deathgasm is the ultimate midnight movie (for metalheads especially), hitting on notes of horror insanity that blend face-melting riffage with equally outstanding practical effects.
1356	\\"At Bloody Disgusting, Brad Miska and Patrick Cooper reviewed the film, and both rated it four out of five stars.
1357	Miska called it \\"the most metal horror film ever\\", and Cooper said that it was \\"the movie the SXSW Midnighters category was created for\\".
1358	Drew Tinnin of Dread Central rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \\"Deathgasm knows exactly what it is and where its heart is, giving genre fans a welcome return to heavy metal in horror without cutting back on any of the splatstick that New Zealand has become known for, for better or worse.\\"
1359	Zach Gayne of Twitch Film wrote, \\"[T]he voice that shines through the hysterical dialogue and playfully comic editing, is so teenage, so punk, it makes a beat-to-death genre feel refreshing.\\"
1360	Heather Wixson of Daily Dead rated it 5/5 stars and called it a \\"ridiculously fun and bombastic celebration of horror and heavy metal\\".
1361	In early 2016, Walmart refused to sell Deathgasm in its current form.
1362	Walmart renamed the film to a more 'acceptable' title \\"Heavy Metal Apocalypse.\\"

1373	The series follows the resulting emotional effects on two families as well as the trials of a group of robots who have attained free will and want their freedom from human ownership.
1374	It premiered on SVT 1 on 22 January 2012.
1375	The series was written by  and directed by Harald Hamrell and .
1376	As of 2013, the series has been sold to about 50 countries, including Australia, France, Germany, and South Korea.
1377	A second season of ten episodes premiered on SVT1 in October 2013.
1378	In April 2013 it was announced that Lars Lundström was writing a third series, but as of August 2014, SVT is yet to officially announce whether the series will be renewed for a third season.
1379	, Lundström said in an interview with Festival Court Métrange, \\"We have planned for a third season, we have written a whole outline and some scripts, but right now it's in decision making (sic); if it's going to happen or not, because we have problem to fund the budget money.
1380	In a couple of weeks, maximum a month, we know, but I'm sorry to say, I'm not very optimistic.\\".
1381	Setting
1382	The story takes place in a version of present-day Sweden where the use of androids is commonplace.
1383	The androids, known as hubots, function as servants, workers, companions, and even illicitly as sexual partners, with different models having specific features designed for their distinctive roles.
1384	While some people embrace this new technology, others are disturbed by it.
1385	A far-right political movement, the \\"real humans\\", arises in opposition to the encroachment of hubots upon human society.
1386	Some members use the derogatory term \\"Pacmans\\" to refer to hubots.
1387	Hubots are usually programmed to recognise and obey their owner and can learn skills and pick up knowledge through observation of humans.
1388	Hubots have begun to replace human workers in many industries, especially in the performance of repetitive tasks.
1389	Though they are designed to closely resemble humans, hubots are usually easy for humans to recognise as they have bright flawless skin, glossy hair and unnaturally bright (usually very blue or very green) eyes.
1390	All Hubots also have a USB-like port, in either the back of the neck or in their lower back, which is used for programming and data.
1391	The button to activate or de-power a hubot is located under the left armpit, as is a standard wall plug cord for recharging purposes.
1392	Hubots require only electricity to survive and must recharge regularly, during which they enter a sleep-like state.
1393	Hubot skin feels similar to human skin and is kept at normal human body temperature, but beneath the skin are metal components and a blue fluid/lubricant known as HubFluid.
1394	Hubots are also programmed to be docile.
1395	They obey a set of rules called \\"Asimov\\" protocols that prevent them from harming humans.
1396	However, some hubots have been modified beyond the legal protocols to function as lovers or bodyguards.

1402	Their code is designed to integrate and balance various emotions simultaneously as opposed to the one-emotion-at-a time code that standard hubots have.
1403	They are still often naive and unworldly and sometimes fail to understand the nuances of complex human behaviour.

1435	Germany (Deutschland ), officially the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland, ), is a country in Central and Western Europe, lying between the Baltic and North Seas to the north, and the Alps to the south.
1436	It borders Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, France to the southwest, and Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands to the west.
1437	Germany includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate.
1438	With 83 million inhabitants, it is the second most populous state of Europe after Russia, the most populous state lying entirely in Europe, as well as the most populous member state of the European Union.
1439	Germany is a very decentralized country.
1440	Its capital and largest metropolis is Berlin, while Frankfurt serves as its financial capital and has the country's busiest airport.
1441	Germany's largest urban area is the Ruhr, with its main centres of Dortmund and Essen.
1442	The country's other major cities are Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Stuttgart, Düsseldorf, Leipzig, Dresden, Bremen, Hannover, and Nuremberg.
1443	Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity.
1444	A region named Germania was documented before 100 AD.
1445	During the Migration Period, the Germanic tribes expanded southward.
1446	Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire.
1447	During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation.
1448	After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the German Confederation was formed in 1815.
1449	The German revolutions of 1848–49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights.
1450	In 1871, Germany became a nation state when most of the German states (most notably excluding Switzerland and Austria) unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire.
1451	After World War I and the revolution of 1918–19, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic.
1452	The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a dictatorship, the annexation of Austria, World War II, and the Holocaust.
1453	After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, Austria was re-established as an independent country and two new German states were founded: West Germany, formed from the American, British, and French occupation zones, and East Germany, formed from the Soviet occupation zone.
1454	Following the Revolutions of 1989 that ended communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, the country was reunified on 3 October 1990.
1455	Today, the sovereign state of Germany is a federal parliamentary republic led by a chancellor.
1456	It is a great power with a strong economy; it has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the fifth-largest by PPP.
1457	As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer of goods.
1458	A developed country with a very high standard of living, it upholds a social security and universal health care system, environmental protection, and a tuition-free university education.
1459	The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1957 and the European Union in 1993.
1460	It is part of the Schengen Area and became a co-founder of the Eurozone in 1999.
1461	Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the G20, and the OECD.
1462	Known for its rich cultural history, Germany has been continuously the home of influential and successful artists, philosophers, musicians, film people, sportspeople, entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers, and inventors.
1463	Germany has a large number of World Heritage sites and is among the top tourism destinations in the world.
1464	EtymologyThe English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania, which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine.
1465	The German term Deutschland, originally diutisciu land (\\"the German lands\\") is derived from  (compare Dutch), descended from Old High German diutisc \\"popular\\" (i.e. belonging to the diot or diota \\"people\\"), originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants.
1466	This in turn descends from Proto-Germanic þiudiskaz \\"popular\\" (see also the Latinised form Theodiscus), derived from þeudō, descended from Proto-Indo-European * \\"people\\", from which the word Teutons also originates.
1467	HistoryThe Nebra sky disk, c. 1700 BC The discovery of the Mauer 1 mandible shows that ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago.
1468	The oldest complete hunting weapons found anywhere in the world were discovered in a coal mine in Schöningen where three 380,000-year-old wooden javelins were unearthed.
1469	The Neander Valley was the location where the first ever non-modern human fossil was discovered; the new species of human was called the Neanderthal.
1470	The Neanderthal 1 fossils are known to be 40,000 years old.
1471	Evidence of modern humans, similarly dated, has been found in caves in the Swabian Jura near Ulm.
1472	The finds included 42,000-year-old bird bone and mammoth ivory flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found, the 40,000-year-old Ice Age Lion Man which is the oldest uncontested figurative art ever discovered, and the 35,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels which is the oldest uncontested human figurative art ever discovered.
1473	The Nebra sky disk is a bronze artefact created during the European Bronze Age attributed to a site near Nebra, Saxony-Anhalt.
1474	It is part of UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme.
1475	Germanic tribes and Frankish EmpireMigrations in Europe (100–500 AD) The Germanic tribes are thought to date from the Nordic Bronze Age or the Pre-Roman Iron Age.
1476	From southern Scandinavia and north Germany, they expanded south, east and west from the 1st century BC, coming into contact with the Celtic tribes of Gaul as well as Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes in Central and Eastern Europe.
1477	Under Augustus, Rome began to invade Germania (an area extending roughly from the Rhine to the Ural Mountains).
1478	In 9 AD, three Roman legions led by Varus were defeated by the Cheruscan leader Arminius.
1479	By 100 AD, when Tacitus wrote Germania, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of the area of modern Germany.
1480	However, Austria, Baden Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hessen and the western Rhineland had been conquered and incorporated into Roman provinces: Noricum, Raetia, Germania Superior, and Germania Inferior.
1481	Frankish Realm and its expansion.
1482	As it was partitioned in 843, West Francia (blue) and East Francia (red) became predecessors of France and Germany, respectively In the 3rd century a number of large West Germanic tribes emerged: Alemanni, Franks, Chatti, Saxons, Frisii, Sicambri, and Thuringii.
1483	Around 260, the Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.
1484	After the invasion of the Huns in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest.
1485	Simultaneously several large tribes formed in what is now Germany and displaced or absorbed smaller Germanic tribes.
1486	Large areas known since the Merovingian period as Austrasia, Neustria, and Aquitaine were conquered by the Franks who established the Frankish Kingdom, and pushed farther east to subjugate Saxony and Bavaria.
1487	Areas of what is today the eastern part of Germany were inhabited by Western Slavic tribes of Sorbs, Veleti and the Obotritic confederation.
1488	East Francia and Holy Roman EmpireIn 800, the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor and founded the Carolingian Empire, which was later divided in 843 among his heirs.
1489	Following the break up of the Frankish Realm, for 900 years, the history of Germany was intertwined with the history of the Holy Roman Empire, which subsequently emerged from the eastern portion of Charlemagne's original empire.
1490	The territory initially known as East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe River in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.
1491	The Ottonian rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major duchies and the German king Otto I was crowned Holy Roman Emperor of these regions in 962.
1492	In 996 Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor.
1493	The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the reign of the Salian emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture Controversy.
1494	Martin Luther (1483–1546) initiated the Protestant Reformation.
1495	In the 12th century, under the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138–1254), German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by Slavs; they encouraged German settlement in these areas, called the eastern settlement movement (Ostsiedlung).
1496	Members of the Hanseatic League, which included mostly north German cities and towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.
1497	In the south, the Greater Ravensburg Trade Corporation (Große Ravensburger Handelsgesellschaft) served a similar function.
1498	The edict of the Golden Bull issued in 1356 by Emperor Charles IV provided the basic constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics.
1499	Population declined in the first half of the 14th century, starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348–50.
1500	Despite the decline, however, German artists, engineers, and scientists developed a wide array of techniques similar to those used by the Italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant city-states as Venice, Florence and Genoa.
1501	Artistic and cultural centres throughout the German states produced such artists as the Augsburg painters Hans Holbein and his son, and Albrecht Dürer.
1502	Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, a development that laid the basis for the spread of learning to the masses.
1503	The Holy Roman Empire in 1648, after the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War In 1517, the Wittenberg monk Martin Luther publicised The Ninety-Five Theses, challenging the Roman Catholic Church and initiating the Protestant Reformation.
1504	In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg established Lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to Catholicism, but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects, a principle called Cuius regio, eius religio.
1505	The agreement at Augsburg failed to address other religious creed: for example, the Reformed faith was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler, such as happened in Electorate of Cologne in 1583.
1506	From the Cologne War until the end of the Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands.
1507	The latter reduced the overall population of the German states by about 30 per cent, and in some places, up to 80 per cent.
1508	The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the Imperial Estates of the Holy Roman Empire.
1509	Their mostly German-speaking rulers were able to choose either Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, or the Reformed faith as their official religion after 1648.
1510	In the 18th century, the Holy Roman Empire consisted of approximately 1,800 territories.
1511	The elaborate legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1450–1555) created the Imperial Estates and provided for considerable local autonomy among ecclesiastical, secular, and hereditary states, reflected in the Imperial Diet.
1512	The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740.
1513	Having no male heirs, he had convinced the Electors to retain Habsburg hegemony in the office of the emperor by agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713.
1514	This was finally settled through the War of Austrian Succession; in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Charles VI's daughter Maria Theresa ruled the Empire as Empress Consort when her husband, Francis I, became Holy Roman Emperor.
1515	From 1740, the dualism between the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated the German history.
1516	In 1772, then again in 1793 and 1795, the two dominant German states of Prussia and Austria, along with the Russian Empire, agreed to the Partitions of Poland; dividing among themselves the lands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
1517	As a result of the partitions, millions of Polish speaking inhabitants fell under the rule of the two German monarchies.
1518	However, the annexed territories though incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Realm, were not legally considered as a part of the Holy Roman Empire.
1519	During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, along with the arrival of the Napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet, most of the secular Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed.
1520	In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved; many German states, particularly the Rhineland states, fell under the influence of France.
1521	Until 1815, France, Russia, Prussia and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars.
1522	German Confederation and EmpireA map showing the German Confederation (1815–1836) with its 39 member states.
1523	Following the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna (convened in 1814) founded the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund), a loose league of 39 sovereign states.
1524	The appointment of the Emperor of Austria as the permanent president of the Confederation reflected the Congress's failure to accept Prussia's rising influence among the German states, and acerbated the long-standing competition between the Hohenzollern and Habsburg interests.
1525	Disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Metternich.
1526	The Zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity in the German states.
1527	National and liberal ideals of the French Revolution gained increasing support among many, especially young, Germans.
1528	The Hambach Festival in May 1832 was a main event in support of German unity, freedom and democracy.
1529	In the light of a series of revolutionary movements in Europe, which established a republic in France, intellectuals and commoners started the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.
1530	King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement.
1531	Foundation of the German Empire in Versailles, 1871.
1532	Bismarck is at the centre in a white uniform.
1533	King William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as the new Minister President of Prussia in 1862.
1534	Bismarck successfully concluded war on Denmark in 1864, which promoted German over Danish interests in the Jutland peninsula.
1535	The subsequent (and decisive) Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation (Norddeutscher Bund) which excluded Austria from the federation's affairs.
1536	After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871 at Versailles, uniting all the scattered parts of Germany except Austria and the German-speaking parts of Switzerland.
1537	Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the Hohenzollern King of Prussia ruled as its concurrent Emperor, and Berlin became its capital.
1538	In the Gründerzeit period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as Chancellor of Germany under Emperor William I secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances, isolating France by diplomatic means, and avoiding war.
1539	Under Wilhelm II, Germany, like other European powers, took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries.
1540	Most alliances in which Germany had previously been involved were not renewed.
1541	This resulted in the creation of a dual alliance with the multinational realm of Austria-Hungary, promoting at least benevolent neutrality if not outright military support.
1542	Subsequently, the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy, completing a Central European geographic alliance that illustrated German, Austrian and Italian fears of incursions against them by France and/or Russia.
1543	Similarly, Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances that would protect them against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.
1544	The German Empire (1871–1918), with the Kingdom of Prussia in blue At the Berlin Conference in 1884, Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa, German South West Africa, Togoland, and Kamerun.
1545	Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include German New Guinea, German Micronesia and German Samoa in the Pacific, and Kiautschou Bay in China.
1546	In what became known as the \\"First Genocide of the Twentieth-Century\\", between 1904 and 1907, the German colonial government in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) ordered the annihilation of the local Herero and Namaqua peoples, as a punitive measure for an uprising against German colonial rule.
1547	In total, around 100,000 people—80% of the Herero and 50% of the Namaqua—perished from imprisonment in concentration camps, where the majority died of disease, abuse, and exhaustion, or from dehydration and starvation in the countryside after being deprived of food and water.
1548	The assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for the Austrian Empire to attack Serbia and trigger World War I. After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed, a general armistice ended the fighting on 11 November, and German troops returned home.
1549	In the German Revolution (November 1918), Emperor Wilhelm II and all German ruling princes abdicated their positions and responsibilities.
1550	Germany's new political leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.
1551	In this treaty, Germany, as part of the Central Powers, accepted defeat by the Allies in one of the bloodiest conflicts of all time.
1552	Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating and unjust and it was later seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler.
1553	After the defeat in the First World War, Germany lost around 13% of its European territory (areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic Polish, French and Danish populations, which were lost following the Greater Poland Uprising, the return of Alsace-Lorraine and the Schleswig plebiscites), and all of its colonial possessions in Africa and the South Sea.
1554	Weimar Republic and Nazi GermanyPhilipp Scheidemann proclaims the German Republic from the Reichskanzlei window, on 9 November 1918.
1555	Germany was declared a federal republic at the beginning of the German Revolution in November 1918, with 18 substates in 1925.
1556	On 11 August 1919 President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution.
1557	In the subsequent struggle for power, the radical-left Communists seized power in Bavaria, but conservative elements in other parts of Germany attempted to overthrow the Republic in the Kapp Putsch.
1558	It was supported by parts of the Reichswehr (military) and other conservative, nationalistic and monarchist factions.
1559	After a tumultuous period of bloody street fighting in the major industrial centres, the occupation of the Ruhr by Belgian and French troops and the rise of inflation culminating in the hyperinflation of 1922–23, a debt restructuring plan and the creation of a new currency in 1924 ushered in the Golden Twenties, an era of increasing artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.
1560	Historians describe the period between 1924 and 1929 as one of \\"partial stabilisation.\\"
1561	The worldwide Great Depression hit Germany in 1929.
1562	After the federal election of 1930, Chancellor Heinrich Brüning's government was enabled by President Paul von Hindenburg to act without parliamentary approval.
1563	Brüning's government pursued a policy of fiscal austerity and deflation which caused high unemployment of nearly 30% by 1932.
1564	The Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler won the special federal election of 1932.
1565	After a series of unsuccessful cabinets, Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933.
1566	After the Reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic civil rights and within weeks the first Nazi concentration camp at Dachau opened.
1567	The Enabling Act of 1933 gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power; subsequently, his government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the League of Nations following a national referendum, and began military rearmament.
1568	Adolf Hitler, leader of Nazi Germany (1933–1945) Using deficit spending, a government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works projects.
1569	In public work projects of 1934, 1.7 million Germans immediately were put to work, which gave them an income and social benefits.
1570	The most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway, the Reichsautobahn, known as the German autobahns.
1571	Other capital construction projects included hydroelectric facilities such as the Rur Dam, water supplies such as Zillierbach Dam, and transportation hubs such as Zwickau Hauptbahnhof.
1572	Over the next five years, unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose.
1573	In 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities.
1574	Germany also reacquired control of the Saar in 1935, remilitarised the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement and in direct violation of the agreement occupied Czechoslovakia with the proclamation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in March 1939.
1575	Kristallnacht, or the \\"Night of Broken Glass\\", saw the burning of hundreds of synagogues, the destruction of thousands of Jewish businesses, and the arrest of around 30,000 Jewish men by Nazi forces inside Germany.
1576	Many Jewish women were arrested and placed in jails and a curfew was placed on the Jewish people in Germany.
1577	In August 1939, Hitler's government negotiated and signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.
1578	Following the agreement, on 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, marking the beginning of World War II in Europe.
1579	WWII, German-occupied Europe in 1942 In response to Hitler's actions, two days later, on 3 September, after a British ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany.
1580	In the spring of 1940, Germany conquered Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France forcing the French government to sign an armistice after German troops occupied most of the country.
1581	The British repelled German air attacks in the Battle of Britain in the same year.
1582	In 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union.
1583	By 1942, Germany and other Axis powers controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa, but following the Soviet Union's victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, the allies' reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats.
1584	In June 1944, the Western allies landed in France and the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe.
1585	By late 1944, the Western allies had entered Germany despite one final German counter offensive in the Ardennes Forest.
1586	Following Hitler's suicide during the Battle of Berlin, German armed forces surrendered on 8 May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.
1587	After World War II, former members of the Nazi regime were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.
1588	In what later became known as The Holocaust, the German government persecuted minorities and used a network of concentration and death camps across Europe to conduct a genocide of what they considered to be inferior peoples.
1589	In total, over 10 million civilians were systematically murdered, including 6 million Jews, between 220,000 and 1,500,000 Romani, 275,000 persons with disabilities, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, thousands of homosexuals, and hundreds of thousands of members of the political and religious opposition from Germany, and occupied countries (Nacht und Nebel).
1590	Nazi policies in the German occupied countries resulted in the deaths of 2.7 million Poles, 1.3 million Ukrainians, 1 million Belarusians and an estimated 2.8 million Soviet war prisoners.
1591	In addition, the Nazi regime abducted approximately 12 million people from across the German occupied Europe for use as slave labour in the German industry.
1592	German military war casualties have been estimated at 5.3 million, and around 900,000 German civilians died; 400,000 from Allied bombing, and 500,000 in the course of the Soviet invasion from the east.
1593	Around 12 million ethnic Germans were expelled from across Eastern Europe.
1594	Germany lost roughly one-quarter of its pre-war territory.
1595	Strategic bombing and land warfare destroyed many cities and cultural heritage sites.
1596	East and West GermanyAmerican, Soviet, British and French occupation zones in Germany, and the French controlled Saar Protectorate, 1947.
1597	Territories east of the Oder-Neisse line transferred to Poland and the Soviet Union under the terms of the Potsdam Conference.
1598	After Nazi Germany surrendered, the Allies partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four military occupation zones.
1599	The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik).
1600	They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany.
1601	East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo.
1602	West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a \\"social market economy\\".
1603	Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the Marshall Plan and used this to rebuild its industry.
1604	Konrad Adenauer was elected the first Federal Chancellor (Bundeskanzler) of Germany in 1949 and remained in office until 1963.
1605	Under his and Ludwig Erhard's leadership, the country enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s, that became known as an \\"economic miracle\\" (Wirtschaftswunder).
1606	The Federal Republic of Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1957.
1607	The Berlin Wall during its fall in 1989, with the Brandenburg Gate in the background.
1608	East Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the USSR via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact.
1609	Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (Politbüro) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany, supported by the Stasi, an immense secret service controlling many aspects of the society.
1610	A Soviet-style command economy was set up and the GDR later became a Comecon state.
1611	While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.
1612	The Berlin Wall, rapidly built on 13 August 1961 prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, eventually becoming a symbol of the Cold War.
1613	Ronald Reagan's \\"Mr. Gorbachov, Tear down this wall!\\" speech at the Wall on 12 June 1987 influenced public opinion, echoing John F. Kennedy's famous Ich bin ein Berliner speech of 26 June 1963.
1614	The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism, the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, German Reunification and Die Wende.
1615	Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the early 1970s by Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik.
1616	In summer 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open the borders, causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary.
1617	This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support.
1618	The East German authorities eased the border restrictions, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West; originally intended to help retain East Germany as a state, the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process.
1619	This culminated in the Two Plus Four Treaty a year later on 12 September 1990, under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the Instrument of Surrender, and Germany regained full sovereignty.
1620	This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR.
1621	Reunified Germany and the European UnionGerman unity was established on 3 October 1990.
1622	Since 1999, the Reichstag building in Berlin has been the meeting place of the Bundestag, the German parliament.
1623	The united Germany is considered to be the enlarged continuation of the Federal Republic of Germany and not a successor state.
1624	As such, it retained all of West Germany's memberships in international organisations.
1625	Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act, adopted in 1994, Berlin once again became the capital of the reunified Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city) retaining some federal ministries.
1626	The relocation of the government was completed in 1999.
1627	Following the 1998 elections, SPD politician Gerhard Schröder became the first Chancellor of a red–green coalition with the Alliance '90/The Greens party.
1628	Among the major projects of the two Schröder legislatures was the Agenda 2010 to reform the labour market to become more flexible and reduce unemployment.
1629	The modernisation and integration of the eastern German economy is a long-term process scheduled to last until the year 2019, with annual transfers from west to east amounting to roughly $80 billion.
1630	Germany became a co-founder of the European Union (1993), introduced the Euro currency (2002), and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007 (pictured).
1631	Since reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union.
1632	Together with its European partners Germany signed the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, established the Eurozone in 1999, and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007.
1633	Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban.
1634	These deployments were controversial since Germany is bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles.
1635	In the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel became the first female chancellor of Germany as the leader of a grand coalition.
1636	In 2009 the German government approved a €50 billion economic stimulus plan to protect several sectors from a downturn.
1637	In 2009, a liberal-conservative coalition under Merkel assumed leadership of the country.
1638	In 2013, a grand coalition was established in a Third Merkel cabinet.
1639	Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration, the energy transition (Energiewende) for a sustainable energy supply, the \\"Debt Brake\\" for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate significantly (pronatalism), and high-tech strategies for the future transition of the German economy, summarised as Industry 4.0.
1640	Germany was affected by the European migrant crisis in 2015 as it became the final destination of choice for many asylum seekers from Africa and the Middle East entering the EU.
1641	The country took in over a million refugees and migrants and developed a quota system which redistributed migrants around its federal states based on their tax income and existing population density.

1653	Most of Germany has a temperate seasonal climate dominated by humid westerly winds.
1654	The country is situated in between the oceanic Western European and the continental Eastern European climate.
1655	The climate is moderated by the North Atlantic Drift, the northern extension of the Gulf Stream.

1669	Plants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe.
1670	Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute one-third of the forests; conifers are increasing as a result of reforestation.
1671	Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in sandy soil.
1672	There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses.
1673	Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver.

1685	Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law are valid in perpetuity.
1686	The president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier (19 March 2017–present), is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers.

1693	The members of the Bundesrat represent the governments of the sixteen federated states and are members of the state cabinets.
1694	Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany.
1695	So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties.
1696	However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party (in parliament from 1949 to 2013 and again since 2017) and the Alliance '90/The Greens (in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles.
1697	Since 2005, the left-wing populist party The Left, formed through the merger of two former parties, has been a staple in the German Bundestag though they have never been part of the federal government.
1698	In the German federal election, 2017, the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.

1706	Criminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the Strafgesetzbuch and the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch respectively.
1707	The German penal system seeks the rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the public.
1708	Except for petty crimes, which are tried before a single professional judge, and serious political crimes, all charges are tried before mixed tribunals on which lay judges (Schöffen) sit side by side with professional judges.

1847	The largest part of people with immigrant background is made up of returning ethnic Germans (Aussiedler and Spätaussiedler), followed by Turkish, European Union, and former Yugoslav citizens.
1848	In the 1960s and 1970s, the German governments invited \\"guest workers\\" (Gastarbeiter) to migrate to Germany for work in the German industries.
1849	Many companies preferred to keep these workers employed in Germany after they had trained them and Germany's immigrant population has steadily increased.
1850	In 2015, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 12 million of all 244 million migrants.
1851	Germany ranks 7th amongst EU countries and 37th globally in terms of the percentage of migrants who made up part of the country's population.

1855	ReligionUpon its establishment in 1871, Germany was about two-thirds Protestant and one-third Roman Catholic, with a notable Jewish minority.
1856	Other faiths existed in the state, but never achieved a demographic significance and cultural impact of these three confessions.
1857	Germany lost nearly all of its Jewish minority during the Holocaust.
1858	Religious makeup changed gradually in the decades following 1945, with West Germany becoming more religiously diversified through immigration and East Germany becoming overwhelmingly irreligious through state policies.
1859	It continues to diversify after the German reunification in 1990, with an accompanying substantial decline in religiosity throughout all of Germany and a contrasting increase of evangelical Protestants and Muslims.

1870	Irreligion in Germany is strongest in the former East Germany, which used to be predominantly Protestant before state atheism, and major metropolitan areas.
1871	An 2017 estimate even shows that 37,0 % of the German population were nonconfessional.
1872	Islam is the second largest religion in the country.
1873	In the 2011 census, 1.9% of the census population (1.52 million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is deemed unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this religion (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question.
1874	Figures from Religionswissenschaftlicher Medien- und Informationsdienst suggest a figure of 4.4 to 4.7 million (around 5.5% of the population) in 2015.
1875	A study conducted by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees found that between 2011 and 2015 the Muslim population rose by 1.2 million people, mostly due to immigration.
1876	Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations.

2063	Steve Harrisnon_vocal_instrumentalistSteve Harris 521.jpgSteve Harris performing in 2008Stephen Percy HarrisLeytonstone, Essex, EnglandHeavy metal, hard rockMusician, songwriterBass guitar, keyboards, vocals1972–presentEMIIron Maiden, British Lion, Lauren Harris, Smiler, Gypsy's KissStephen Percy Harris (born 12 March 1956) is an English musician, songwriter, bassist, occasional keyboardist, backing vocalist, primary songwriter and founder of the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden.
2064	He has been the band's only constant member since their inception in 1975 and, along with guitarist Dave Murray, one of only two members to have appeared on all of their albums.
2065	Harris has a recognisable and popular style of bass playing, particularly the \\"gallop\\" which can be found on several Iron Maiden recordings, such as the singles \\"Run to the Hills\\" and \\"The Trooper\\".
2066	In addition to his role as the band's bass player, writer and backing vocalist, he has undertaken many other roles for the group, such as producing and co-producing their albums, directing and editing their live videos and performing studio keyboards and synthesizers.
2067	He has been cited as one of the greatest heavy metal bassists.
2068	On 24 September 2012, Harris released his debut solo album, British Lion.
2069	Early lifeHarris was born and grew up in Leytonstone, where he grew up aspiring to be a professional footballer.
2070	Scouted by Wally St Pier, Harris was asked to train for West Ham United.
2071	After gaining an interest in rock music in his early teens, he realised that he no longer desired to play football professionally.
2072	Initially Harris wanted to play drums, but did not have enough space for a drum kit in his house and so decided on the bass instead.
2073	Entirely self-taught, his first bass was a copy of a Fender Precision model which cost him £40 in 1971.
2074	Just 10 months after he bought his first bass, Harris joined a band, initially known as Influence and later Gypsy's Kiss, featuring Bob Verscoyle (lead vocals), Dave Smith (guitar) and drummer Paul Sears.
2075	After a short number of gigs at the Cart and Horses pub in Maryland Point, Stratford and the Bridgehouse in Canning Town, the band split up and Harris auditioned for a band called Smiler in February 1974.
2076	In this outfit, Harris began writing his own songs and worked with future Iron Maiden members Dennis Wilcock and Doug Sampson, but left the band after they refused to play his material, claiming it was too complicated.
2077	CareerIron MaidenUpon leaving Smiler, Harris went on to create Iron Maiden on Christmas Day 1975, with the band's name being inspired by the film The Man in the Iron Mask.
2078	Before Iron Maiden signed their contract with EMI in 1979, Harris worked as an architectural draughtsman in the East End of London (he had studied architectural drawing at Leyton Sixth Form College) until he was made redundant, at which point he undertook a job as a street sweeper.
2079	Since their inception, Harris has been the band's principal composer and lyricist.
2080	His song writing typically showcases his trademark galloping bass patterns, which features heavily in songs such as \\"The Trooper\\" and \\"Run to the Hills\\", and his progressive rock-influenced time changes.
2081	Recently, Harris' songs have become more progressive, and guitarist Adrian Smith has commented that Harris now prefers contributing \\"lyrics and melodies and arranging\\" to other member's songs over writing alone.
2082	Harris frequently writes lyrics about mythology, history or topics inspired from books and films, reflecting his interests and progressive rock influences.
2083	Solo projectIn September 2012, Harris released his first solo album, British Lion.
2084	Originating with a band, named British Lion, which he managed and wrote with in the early 1990s, Harris kept in touch with its vocalist, Richard Taylor, and guitarist, Graham Leslie, and the album, consisting of 1970s influenced hard rock songs, was written and recorded over a number of years around Iron Maiden's tour schedule.
2085	Speaking to Kerrang!
2086	in September 2012, Harris stated that he considers the record to be \\"more of a side-project\\" than a solo album, as he is more \\"comfortable in a band environment.
2087	\\"In an interview with Classic Rock in August, Harris stated that he will be releasing more solo albums and hopes to tour with the band in the future.
2088	Harris has taken the outfit on two separate European club tours in 2013 and 2014, with an additional tour taking place in 2016.
2089	On 2 September 2016, Harris announced that he intends to issue a live album recorded at shows from across the three tours.
2090	Personal lifeHarris at West Ham United's Boleyn Ground during Soccer Six 2005.
2091	Harris' eldest daughter, Lauren, is a singer and supported Iron Maiden with her solo outfit in 2006 and 2008.
2092	In 2008, she released a solo album, entitled Calm Before the Storm, and is currently a member of a band called Kingdom of I after forming Six Hour Sundown.
2093	In addition, Harris' oldest son, George, plays guitar in a band, the Raven Age, who were the opening act on Iron Maiden's The Book Of Souls World Tour in 2016.
2094	His second-oldest daughter, Kerry, works as a Production Assistant for Iron Maiden while his third-oldest daughter, Faye, is a fashion writer for HuffPost.
2095	In 1993, Harris was divorced from his wife, Lorraine, whom he met 16 years previously.
2096	He later said this was \\"probably the toughest time I've ever faced,\\" and the changes in his personal life are credited with inspiring the mood of the following Iron Maiden album, 1995's The X Factor.
2097	Harris has four children with Lorraine: Lauren, Kerry, Faye and George, and two children with current partner Emma: Stanley and Maisie.
2098	Since the 1980s, Harris has owned a Grade II listed building in Sheering Essex, in the grounds of which he built his own recording and editing studio, \\"Barnyard\\".
2099	In November 2012, the nine-acre property was put on sale, with a spokesman for his estate agent, Hamptons International, stating that \\"he now lives between Los Angeles and the Bahamas\\".
2100	A keen footballer, Harris played for amateur clubs as a child and was later scouted by Wally St Pier and asked to train for West Ham United, of whom he has been a fan since he was 9 years old.
2101	Although he had aspired to play professionally up to that point, Harris would eventually realise that \\"it wasn't really what [he] wanted to do.\\"
2102	Nevertheless, Harris still plays football regularly with his own team, \\"Maidonians\\", and still supports West Ham, staying in contact with the club, and having their crest on his most-used Precision Bass.
2103	Musical styleTechniqueHarris is often considered among the best and most influential heavy metal bassists.
2104	He is most known for his \\"galloping\\" playing style: usually an eighth note followed by two sixteenth notes at fast tempo (e.g., \\"The Trooper\\" and \\"Run to the Hills\\") or eighth note triplets, which he plays with two fingers, rather than using a plectrum.
2105	Before playing, Harris often chalks his fingers, to make these fast patterns easier to play, as shown on the bonus DVD for the A Matter of Life and Death album.
2106	Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers has commented that \\"Steve taught himself in a way that nobody can really copy it.
2107	People say it's like a lead guitar, but it's not.
2108	It gives the band a basis and it moves around quite a lot, but it's the tone that he has.
2109	Steve has a way of hearing things and a tone that isn't normally associated with a bass, it's more like a rhythm guitar.\\"
2110	InfluencesHarris was influenced by the progressive rock bands of the 1970s, as well as early hard rock and heavy metal bands.
2111	His influences include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Thin Lizzy, UFO, Uriah Heep, Wishbone Ash, and Yes.
2112	Speaking about the early Iron Maiden sound, Steve Harris described the band as using twin-guitar harmonies inspired by Wishbone Ash and Thin Lizzy, complex time and mood changes from Genesis and Jethro Tull, and the dark melodic elements of Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and Led Zeppelin.
2113	EquipmentHarris mainly plays a specially-painted Fender Precision Bass, featured on every Iron Maiden album, which has gone through a total of four colour changes since he began using it.
2114	Originally white, it was then changed to black prior to the band's first album, followed by blue sparkle and finally white with claret and blue pinstriping with the West Ham United F.C. crest.
2115	Harris has had his bass modified to include a mirrored scratchplate, Badass bridges and Seymour Duncan custom SPB-1 pickups and uses his own signature set of RotoSound flatwound strings.
2116	In 2009, Fender issued a signature Steve Harris Precision bass, featuring an alder body, a blue-sparkle finish, mirrored scratchplate, Seymour Duncan SPB-1 pickups and a Badass II bridge.
2117	In 2015, Fender released a revised model of the signature bass, which now features a maple body, a white finish with blue pinstripes and the West Ham crest, a Fender High Mass bridge and a Seymour Duncan SPB-4 Steve Harris signature pickup, with the pickup also being sold separately.
2118	In 2005, Metal Hammer reported that he uses eight 4x12\\" Marshall cabinets with Trace Elliot amplifiers.
2119	He also uses four Sony WRT 27 wireless transmitters, allowing him to be as mobile as possible on stage.
2120	A diagram of Harris' 2000 bass rig is documented on GuitarGeek.com.
2121	Other interests and talents
2122	In addition to playing bass and writing music/lyrics for the band, Steve Harris has taken on numerous other roles, such as:music production/mixingmusic video directing/editinglive video directing/editingkeyboardsbacking vocalsstring/bass synthesizersAlthough he performed keyboards on Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, along with guitarist Adrian Smith, in 1988, Harris only began regularly contributing keyboards to Iron Maiden's studio albums from Virtual XI onwards.
2123	Until Virtual XI, Michael Kenney, Harris' bass technician, had provided the keyboards from 1990's No Prayer for the Dying onwards, and still does so live and acts as a supervisor in the studio.
2124	Along with Smith and guitarist Dave Murray, Harris experimented with synthesizers on the Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son albums, using bass synth on Somewhere in Time, and performing \\"string synth\\" keyboards on Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.
2125	Steve Harris is also known for playing an increasing role in mixing the band's albums and produced most of their 1990's output, with recording taking place at a studio he owned at the time, located in a barn on his property, named \\"Barnyard Studios\\".
2126	Since 2000's Brave New World, at Bruce Dickinson's insistence, the band did not record again at Barnyard, which Dickinson claims had limitations due to its size, and hired Kevin Shirley, with whom Harris co-produces.
2127	Harris also directs and edits many of the band's live videos, beginning with Maiden England in 1989.
2128	Although not intending to himself, Harris edited the Rock in Rio DVD as he was unsatisfied with the results produced by the band's hired production crew.
2129	In undertaking the project, Harris had to teach himself how to use digital editing software with equipment he had installed in Barnyard Studios, and went on to edit Iron Maiden's next DVD, Death on the Road.
2130	On top of this, he has contributed to the production of thirteen of the band's music videos, with \\"Infinite Dreams\\", \\"Holy Smoke\\", \\"Tailgunner\\" and \\"Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter\\" being directed and edited by Harris alone.

2148	Generally, power metal is characterized by a faster, lighter, and more uplifting sound, in contrast with the heaviness and dissonance prevalent for example in extreme metal.
2149	Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound.
2150	The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.
2151	OriginsAnthropologist Sam Dunn traced the origins of power metal back to the late 1970s, when the groundwork for power metal lyrical style was laid down by Ronnie James Dio.
2152	The fantasy-oriented lyrics he wrote for Rainbow, concentrated around medieval, renaissance, folk, and science fiction themes, directly influenced modern power metal bands.
2153	It is mentioned that songs \\"Stargazer\\" and \\"A Light in the Black\\", from the 1976 album Rising and 1978's Long Live Rock 'n' Roll, \\"Kill the King\\" and \\"Lady of the Lake\\", respectively, might be among the earliest examples of power metal.
2154	In his 2011 documentary series Metal Evolution, Dunn further explained how Rob Halford of Judas Priest created a blueprint for power metal vocal delivery.
2155	His almost constant high-pitched singing became one of the main characteristics of power metal.
2156	The twin-guitar sound promoted by duo of K. K. Downing and Glenn Tipton highly influenced this subgenre.
2157	Another pioneer in the power metal genre is Jon Mikl Thor, who was a strong inspiration to the American band Manowar.
2158	Another British band, Iron Maiden, brought epic and melodic sensibility to metal, creating anthemic, singalong music, an approach widely embraced by modern power metal musicians.
2159	The emergence of the early German power metal scene in particular was made possible by Scorpions and Accept.
2160	Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen made a significant impact on many future power metal guitarists, with his accurate and fast neo-classical style.
2161	His bandmate Jens Johansson modernized the keyboard sound of Deep Purple's Jon Lord, which was further incorporated into the genre.
2162	Manowar's mythological sword and sorcery lyrics influenced a number of power metal bands.
2163	In 1987 Helloween released their second album, Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I, cited by Allmusic as \\"a landmark recording that remains arguably the single most influential power metal album to date.
2164	Its volatile combination of power and melody would inspire an entire generation of metal bands\\".
2165	Musical characteristicsKai Hansen of Gamma Ray, ex-Helloween during a show in Barcelona, Spain.
2166	Hansen is widely regarded as the \\"godfather of power metal\\".
2167	Power metal is today associated with fast tempo and melodic harmonies, the sound tempered by characteristics of speed metal, power metal's musical forerunner.
2168	VocalsPower metal is highly focused on the vocalist, with \\"clean\\" vocals being much more prevalent than the growling vocals often associated with extreme metal.
2169	Inspired by Ronnie James Dio, Bruce Dickinson, Rob Halford, Geoff Tate and other heavy metal vocalists, power metal vocals are often in a high register, and the singer's vocal range is usually wide.
2170	The majority of the genre's vocalists sing in the tenor range and are capable of hitting very high notes, for example Timo Kotipelto of Stratovarius, Tony Kakko of Sonata Arctica,  Michael Kiske (ex-Helloween) and Andre Matos (ex-Angra).
2171	There are many exceptions who sing in either baritone or bass range.
2172	Some vocalists sing in a harsh, thrash metal style, including Chris Boltendahl of Grave Digger, Kai Hansen of Gamma Ray and Peavy Wagner of Rage, or even make use of growls, like Alexi Laiho of Children of Bodom and Wintersun's Jari Mäenpää.
2173	Many power metal vocalists, most notably Hansi Kürsch of Blind Guardian, record multi-layered vocals reminiscent of Queen creating a choral effect.
2174	Lyrical themesPower metal's lyrical themes often focus on fantasy and mythology, camaraderie and hope, personal struggles and emotions, war and death, or combinations of the listed themes.
2175	For example, Finnish band Sonata Arctica have been known for focusing their lyrics of their songs on fantasy but also have many songs based on reality, love and relationships.
2176	Many Power metal bands based their concept albums on fantasy books and national epics; for example Blind Guardian based their Nightfall in Middle-Earth on The Silmarillion by Tolkien and Kamelot based Epica and The Black Halo on Goethe's Faust.
2177	Some bands have even written their own imaginary stories, like Rhapsody of Fire's Emerald Sword Saga and The Dark Secret Saga, Iced Earth's Something Wicked Saga or Avantasia by Edguy's Tobias Sammet.
2178	Many otherwise typical metal themes such as religion and politics are comparatively rare but not unheard of.
2179	Historical themes have also been used.
2180	Sabaton's main lyrical themes focus on historical wars, war battles and individuals of war who are and have been notably recognized in war.
2181	Examples include World War I, World War II, Vikings, Samurai, and much more from around the world including the American, Swedish and German militaries.
2182	Serenity, an Austrian (symphonic) power metal band, focuses mainly on historical figures and events, including Sir Francis Drake, Marco Polo, Galileo, Beethoven, and Napoleon.
2183	InstrumentationPower metal guitarists and bassists generally play rapid streams of notes, but change chords comparatively slowly, with a harmonic tempo of once per measure or slower.
2184	Fast and technically demanding guitar solos, however, are almost guaranteed.
2185	The slow changing of chords is significant in defining power metal just as the fast rapid chord changes often define traditional thrash metal.
2186	Power metal often makes use of Major chord progressions as well as circle progressions.
2187	Some of the most influential and acclaimed power metal guitarists are Kai Hansen of Gamma Ray, Michael Weikath of Helloween, and Timo Tolkki formerly of Stratovarius.
2188	It is a common trait in power metal for the bass guitar to take a back seat, so to speak; often simply providing the chord root notes and being drowned out by the more prevalent rhythm guitars.
2189	However, some power metal bands incorporate bass that is more audible with colorful patterns distinct from the rhythm guitars, such as Helloween, Hibria, and Symphony X.Many power metal drummers play double bass patterns with either two bass drums, or utilize a double bass pedal; using them to play a constant stream of sixteenth notes (semiquavers) with snare drum accents on the beat, a style not restricted to, but most often associated with, power metal.
2190	The style was used by drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg of Helloween, setting a blueprint for many other drummers to follow.
2191	Others, such as the drummers of Blind Guardian and Iced Earth, use a more thrash metal style of drumming with rapid bursts of double bass that involve three to six beats with the double kick.
2192	Power metal bands often incorporate keyboards into their musical arrangements, something popularized by Jens Johansson of Stratovarius, though their usage varies from subtle accents to a full-blown melody line.
2193	Some power metal bands also record with symphonic elements, and as such, they utilize a full orchestra to fill the role usually played by the keyboardist.
2194	StylesAmerican styleThis branch of power metal emerged in early 1980s in the United States, drawing its influences mainly from traditional metal and the NWOBHM.
2195	Though very close to its roots, US power metal (often abbreviated USPM) is often faster and more energetic than traditional heavy metal, with a more riff-driven approach than its later European counterpart and with a relative lack of keyboards, but more melodic and often with a higher emphasis on guitar leads than thrash metal.
2196	USPM is also notable for its wide (but not universal) use of high-register operatic vocals, a trend which would continue with the rise of European power metal in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
2197	This style is not exclusive to North America, as European bands such as Sacred Steel, Majesty, and Australian band Pegazus later adopted a style inspired by USPM bands in the 1990s.
2198	The early releases of progressive metal bands Queensrÿche and Fates Warning, such as The Warning (1984) and The Spectre Within (1985), heavily influenced a number of bands that were to develop a common sound towards the late 1980s.
2199	Among the better known representatives of the style, such as Manowar, Vicious Rumors, Virgin Steele, Riot or Jag Panzer, a small number of bands enriched their sound with progressive and epic elements; the most obvious examples being Crimson Glory, Savatage, Sanctuary and the epic doom metal band Cirith Ungol.
2200	US power metal saw a sharp decline in popularity at the beginning of the 1990s, though the style has rebounded somewhat in the past decade, with bands such as Liege Lord or Heir Apparent reforming for live performances and some, like Helstar, Artizan, Omen and Manilla Road, releasing new material.
2201	European styleItalian band Rhapsody of Fire performing in Buenos Aires in 2010.
2202	European power metal originated from speed metal and the NWOBHM, emerging in late 1980s, particularly in Germany, with Helloween, Running Wild, Rage, Grave Digger and Blind Guardian, followed by Finland's Stratovarius in late 1980s and the early 1990s.
2203	These bands pioneered the genre, but took it in somewhat different directions.
2204	Helloween, followed by early Gamma Ray, mixed fast palm muted speed metal riffs with high-pitched clean vocals, and with a strong focus on melody and uplifting, positive themes.
2205	Stratovarius further developed this melodic direction by making heavy use of keyboards, with lyrics dealing with emotions and personal issues.
2206	Blind Guardian utilized the technique of vocal and guitar overdubbing to create an epic atmosphere, with lyrical content strongly based on fantasy novels, myths and legends.
2207	The symphonic and neo-classical elements also found their way through power metal with bands like Rhapsody of Fire, Serenity and Nightwish.
2208	HammerFall simplified their power metal to bring it closer to traditional heavy metal.
2209	This genre spread over Europe, often incorporating further influences from progressive and folk music.
2210	Italy's Elvenking, Sweden's Falconer and Denmark's Wuthering Heights are in particular influenced by folk music, while Angra, Kamelot, and especially Symphony X (though none of these 3 are European) are known for combining progressive and power metal.
2211	Furthermore, some bands are known for combining power metal with more aggressive musical forms, such as Children of Bodom, who combined elements of power and melodic death metal, or Iced Earth, who combined power and thrash metal.
2212	Two Helloween albums, Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I (1987) and Part II (1988) are usually considered the first proper European power metal albums.
2213	European style power metal became widespread in comparison with US style as of the mid 1990s, with numerous North American bands such as Theocracy, Borealis, Forgotten Tales, Avian, Pharaoh, Nevermore, Circle II Circle, and Kamelot demonstrating the style.
2214	This European style of power metal is sometimes considered the \\"second wave\\" of power metal since its origination was in the late 1980s rather than the mid 1980s, and the widespread influence and development of the genre that came in its tow while US \\"first wave\\" style markedly declined.

2218	The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and former lead singer Tarja Turunen.
2219	The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, Angels Fall First (1997).
2220	In 2001, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers.
2221	Although Nightwish have been prominent in their home country since Angels Fall First, they did not achieve wider success until the release of the albums Oceanborn (1998), Wishmaster (2000) and Century Child (2002).
2222	Their 2004 album, Once, has sold more than one million copies and was the band's breakthrough in the United States.
2223	Their biggest US hit single, \\"Wish I Had an Angel\\" (2004), received MTV airplay and was included on three US film soundtracks to promote their North American tour.
2224	The band produced three more singles and two music videos for Once, as well as a re-recording of \\"Sleeping Sun\\" for the compilation album, Highest Hopes: The Best of Nightwish (2005), before Turunen's dismissal in October 2005.
2225	Her last performance with Nightwish was during a concert recorded for the live album/DVD End of an Era.
2226	After the concert, the other members informed Turunen with an open letter that she was no longer a member of Nightwish.
2227	In May 2007, Nightwish announced Anette Olzon as Turunen's replacement.
2228	That September, the band released their sixth album, Dark Passion Play, which has sold almost 2 million copies.
2229	The album's lead single, \\"Amaranth\\", became one of Nightwish's most successful in Europe.
2230	The supporting tour, one of the band's largest, started on October 6, 2007 and ended on September 19, 2009.
2231	The band released an EP/live album, Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places), in March 2009 as a CD/DVD, and their seventh studio album, Imaginaerum, was released globally on various days in late 2011/early 2012.
2232	On October 1, 2012, Nightwish announced that they had parted ways with Olzon and would be finishing the tour with at that time ReVamp vocalist (ex-After Forever) Floor Jansen.
2233	In October 2013, Nightwish made Jansen and longtime session uilleann pipes player Troy Donockley permanent members of the band, and they were featured in the acclaimed album Endless Forms Most Beautiful, released on March 27, 2015.
2234	Nightwish is the third-best-selling band and musical entity in Finland with certified sales of nearly 900,000 certified copies.
2235	The group is also the most successful Finnish band worldwide, selling more than 9 million records and receiving more than 60 gold and platinum awards, having released five Number 1 albums and thirteen Number 1 singles.
2236	On October 26th, 2018, Nightwish has been inducted to the Finnish Music Hall of Fame, becoming the honorary gallery's 11th member.
2237	HistoryFormation (1996)Tuomas Holopainen (left) and Emppu Vuorinen (right), two of the band's founding members.
2238	After playing keyboards in several heavy metal bands in the 1990s, including Nattvindens Gråt and Darkwoods My Betrothed, Tuomas Holopainen decided to create his own project while sitting around a campfire with friends in 1996.
2239	He immediately had a clear idea of the music: experimental acoustic music he wrote himself during his time in the Finnish Army, similar to the music usually played around campfires, but with a distinct sound and atmosphere, played on his keyboards.
2240	He soon invited friend and schoolmate Erno \\"Emppu\\" Vuorinen to play acoustic guitars, and the classical vocalist Tarja Turunen, who shared the same music teacher, Plamen Dimov.
2241	The three musicians recorded their self-titled acoustic demo in winter 1996.
2242	The name \\"Nightwish\\" was derived from their first song together – the demo also included the song \\"The Forever Moments\\", and an early version of \\"Etiäinen\\".
2243	Debut album and first tour (1997–1998)In early 1997, following the release of the Nightwish demo, Jukka \\"Julius\\" Nevalainen joined the band, and acoustic guitar was replaced with electric guitar.
2244	The addition of heavy metal elements to the band's existing experimental style gave the band a different sound, forming the core of the Nightwish sound.
2245	The band entered the studio in April 1997 to record seven songs for their second demo, Angels Fall First.
2246	In May 1997, the demo made its way to the Finnish record label Spinefarm Records, who wanted to release it as the band's debut album of the same name.
2247	The label offered Nightwish to a record deal, and the band returned to the studio to record four more songs to accompany the tracks of the demo.
2248	The full-length album was released in November 1997 and reached number 31 on the Finnish album charts, with the single \\"The Carpenter\\" reaching number 3 on the Finnish singles chart.
2249	\\"The Carpenter\\" single was released as a split with label mates Children of Bodom and Thy Serpent; the album is also one of the two releases which features Holopainen's vocals, appearing on four of the album's eleven tracks alongside Turunen's.
2250	The band made their live debut in their hometown Kitee in December 1997.
2251	Since they were missing a bass player, Samppa Hirvonen joined them as a sessional live member.
2252	Marianna Pellinen was also a sessional live member as an additional keyboard player and a backing vocalist for Turunen.
2253	There were plans to make Hirvonen a permanent member, but he joined the army as part of Finnish army conscription just as they began recording Oceanborn, so they asked Sami Vänskä to join instead, since Tuomas knew him from the band Nattvindens Gråt.
2254	During the winter of 1997 and 1998, the band performed only seven times, because Turunen was finishing her schooling, and Nevalainen and Vuorinen were serving their obligatory Finnish military service.
2255	Nightwish returned to the studio in August 1998 as a five-piece to record their follow-up album for Spinefarm Records.
2256	International success (1998–2000)On October 7, 1998, Nightwish released their second full-length album, Oceanborn, in Finland only.
2257	Adopting a more technical and progressive sound than Angels Fall First, Oceanborn saw the band abandon much of the ambient and folk elements present on their debut release, with the exception of the song \\"Moondance\\".
2258	In contrast to the female vocals of Turunen, the album also featured guest growling vocals by Tapio Wilska (ex-Finntroll), since Tuomas did not want to sing again.
2259	Wilska is also a former member of Nattvindens Gråt.
2260	AllMusic review said that the album \\"as a whole works great\\", with songs that are \\"very strong\\".
2261	Oceanborn was an instant success in Finland, reaching number 5 on the Finnish album charts.
2262	The album's first single, \\"Sacrament of Wilderness\\", hit number 1 on the Finnish singles charts, where it stayed for several weeks.
2263	The album's release was initially limited to Finland, but because of the success of \\"Sacrament of Wilderness\\", Spinefarm released Oceanborn internationally in the spring of 1999.
2264	In May 1999, Nightwish recorded the single \\"Sleeping Sun (Four Ballads of the Eclipse)\\", and in one month the single sold 15,000 copies in Germany alone.
2265	Following the band's first international success, Nightwish was added as the opening band for Rage's 1999 European tour.
2266	Both the album Oceanborn and the singles \\"Sacrament of Wilderness\\" and \\"Walking in the Air\\" were certified gold in Finland in August 1999.
2267	While in the studio in early 2000 working on their third album, Nightwish was accepted in the Finnish Eurovision Song Contest tryouts with the song \\"Sleepwalker\\".
2268	Despite winning the public vote, Nightwish eventually finished in third place, with the jury choosing local gospel singer Nina Åström to represent Finland.
2269	On May 19, 2000, Nightwish released their third studio album Wishmaster.
2270	This debuted at No. 1 on the Finnish album charts, and was certified gold in Finland after three weeks at number one.
2271	Critical response to the album was mixed, with Allmusic citing the album as repetitive, and saying \\"as a whole album, it can be a little annoying, even frustrating\\".
2272	However, German magazine Rock Hard declared Wishmaster \\"Album of the Month\\", despite competing against long-awaited May releases from Iron Maiden and Bon Jovi.
2273	Following the release of Wishmaster, Nightwish embarked on their first world tour, playing dates in South America, Mexico, Canada, and the first headlining European tour with Sinergy and Eternal Tears of Sorrow.
2274	In the summer, the band returned to Europe, appearing at the Wacken Open Air festival and the Biebop Metal Fest.
2275	New bassist and symphonic elements (2001–2003)In 2001, Nightwish recorded a cover of Gary Moore's \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" together with two new songs (\\"10th Man Down\\", unreleased from Oceanborn sessions, and \\"Away\\", unreleased from Wishmaster sessions) and a remake of \\"Astral Romance\\" (from the Angels Fall First album) with Tony Kakko (Sonata Arctica) singing Tuomas' part.
2276	This new material was released as their first (and until 2009 the only) EP, Over the Hills and Far Away.
2277	The record also included guest performances by Tapio Wilska once again on \\"10th Man Down\\".
2278	Nightwish's version of \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" was well received by fans, becoming a frequent part of the band's live performances, but the other songs never had a great break-through and have not been re-released, with the exception of a live performance of \\"10th Man Down\\" on the End of Innocence DVD with Marco Hietala (current bass player and male vocalist).
2279	In the same year, they also released (as VHS, DVD and CD) their first live album, From Wishes to Eternity, recorded during a show in Tampere, Finland, on December 29, 2000.
2280	Soon after the release of Over the Hills and Far Away, Nightwish met what has been described as one of their hardest points as a band.
2281	The issues centered on the bassist, Sami Vänskä, who had started misbehaving towards the band, according to Holopainen, by missing appointments and failing to take gigs as seriously as the other members did.
2282	After the band discussed his behavior with Vänskä several times, without getting any change, everyone simply stopped caring and tensions grew.
2283	Meanwhile, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen had started complaining about his role in the band, feeling like \\"a hired gun who would only do what he's asked to\\".
2284	According to their music teacher, Plamen Dimov, he and Holopainen have totally different characters, and thus difficulties were expected to arise.
2285	But Vuorinen was told to stay cool and \\"bite the bullet\\", and the problem was never addressed again.
2286	Later, Holopainen confessed that, at that time, he seriously started thinking about breaking Nightwish up.
2287	After a gig in Russia, he sent a text message to fellow musician Tony Kakko of metal band Sonata Arctica, telling him that he did not think he had a band any longer, and asking him what plans he had for next year.
2288	After Nightwish's last gig for the Over the Hills and Far Away tour in 2001, Holopainen called their labels Drakkar and Spinefarm, unofficially declaring Nightwish was over.
2289	He told them he might produce another album, but he'd never perform another show with the band.
2290	The same message was also written on the band's message board.
2291	Nightwish's current bassist, Marco Hietala, who replaced Sami Vänskä in late 2001.
2292	Straight after the last gig, Holopainen went on a week-long hiking trip to Lapland with Tony Kakko.
2293	During the hiking trip, they talked about the band and Holopainen decided he could not break up Nightwish that easily.
2294	When he returned from Lapland he immediately received a phone call from Ewo Pohjola, CEO of Spinefarm, offering himself to become their manager and help him straighten things up, and Holopainen agreed.
2295	In order to continue with Nightwish, Holopainen decided some changes were in order.
2296	Beside choosing Ewo as their new manager, he also asked Vänskä to leave the band.
2297	He would later cite musical differences  as another reason for the breakup.
2298	Marco Hietala (Tarot) was asked to replace Vänskä, effectively leaving his previous band Sinergy.
2299	As well as playing bass guitar, Hietala would also perform male vocals.
2300	Holopainen has since said publicly that he and Vänskä still keep in touch, contrary to rumours saying that they have not met since.
2301	However, they are not interested in making another project together.
2302	In 2002, Nightwish released Century Child, along with the singles \\"Ever Dream\\" and \\"Bless the Child\\".
2303	The main difference from previous albums is the use of a live Finnish orchestra on the tracks \\"Bless the Child\\", \\"Ever Dream\\", \\"Feel For You\\" and \\"The Beauty of the Beast\\".
2304	An enduring favorite of fans, though, is the band's version of \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\", from the famous musical of the same name by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.
2305	The song was repeatedly played on concerts until vocalist Tarja Turunen was replaced with Anette Olzon, whereupon the band announced that they would never play the song live again.
2306	Century Child was certified gold two hours after its release, and platinum two weeks afterwards.
2307	It set a record on the Finnish album charts as well: Never before had a first place album been so distant from the second place.
2308	After the \\"Bless the Child\\" music video, a second one was recorded, without any single support.
2309	The chosen track was \\"End of All Hope\\".
2310	The clip contains pieces from the Finnish movie, Kohtalon kirja (English: The Book of Fate).
2311	In 2003, Nightwish released their second DVD, the documentary End of Innocence.
2312	It tells the story of the band in Holopainen, Nevalainen and Tapio Wilska's words for two hours.
2313	The documentary also features bits of live concerts, exclusive footage, etc. vocalist Tarja Turunen also got married during the summer of 2003, and there were rumours that the band was about to be dissolved.
2314	These rumors were, at the time, proven to be false, as the band continued to play concerts for another year and released another album.
2315	Tarja's marriage later played a part in her dismissal from the band in the autumn of 2005.
2316	Chart-topping success of Once and Turunen's dismissal (2004–2005)A new album, Once, was released on June 7, 2004, along with its first single, \\"Nemo\\".
2317	The single topped the charts in Finland and Hungary, and reached the charts in six additional countries.
2318	\\"Nemo\\" remains the band's most successful single release to date.
2319	Once utilizes a full orchestra in nine of the eleven songs on the album.
2320	Unlike Century Child, Nightwish decided to look for an orchestra outside of Finland this time, choosing the London Philharmonic Orchestra.
2321	It is also their second album to feature a full-length song in Finnish, \\"Kuolema tekee taiteilijan\\" (English: \\"Death Makes an Artist\\").
2322	Once has sold triple platinum in Finland, platinum in Germany, and Gold in 6 other countries, it also reached No. 1 in the Greek, Norwegian and German album charts, and charted the Top 10 in France, Hungary and Sweden.
2323	The following singles were: \\"Wish I Had an Angel\\" (featured on the soundtrack of the film Alone in the Dark), \\"Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan\\" (released only in Finland and Japan) and \\"The Siren\\".
2324	Besides the commercial success, Once was also well received by critics, with many positive reviewers drawing comparisons with Oceanborn.
2325	Nightwish live in Jämsä, Finland, on June 25, 2005 The success of the album allowed them to perform the Once World Tour, taking them to play in many countries the band had never visited before.
2326	Nightwish performed at the opening ceremony of the 2005 World Championships in Athletics, held in Helsinki, highlighting the acclaim the band had gained.
2327	A \\"best of\\" album, Highest Hopes, was released in September 2005.
2328	The compilation also featured a live cover \\"High Hopes\\" (from the Pink Floyd album The Division Bell) ([//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/Nightwish-highhopes.ogg sample]).
2329	Besides \\"High Hopes\\", a remake of \\"Sleeping Sun\\" (from Oceanborn) was included on the album and released as a single.
2330	A video for the remake was shot, featuring a medieval battle, and can be found on the German release of the single and as a separate DVD released by Spinefarm.
2331	The four other members of Nightwish had decided that it was best to continue Nightwish without Turunen.
2332	After a concert in the Hartwall Areena (Helsinki) on October 21, 2005, recorded for the live DVD End of an Era (released June 2006), they expressed their decision through an open letter which was given to Turunen by Holopainen, and afterwards posted on the band's website.
2333	It was written by Holopainen and signed by all four band members.
2334	The main justification given in the letter for Turunen's dismissal was that the band felt that both her husband Marcelo Cabuli (an Argentine businessman) and commercial interests had changed her attitude towards the band.
2335	Turunen responded to the incident twice, during press conferences in Finland and Germany, saying that her dismissal came entirely as a shock to her, given that she had not been notified before the letter was given to her.
2336	She felt that the personal attacks on her husband were unwarranted, and that playing the issue out in public was \\"senselessly cruel\\".
2337	She expressed these feelings through her own open letter, which was published on her personal website, and through various TV, magazine, and newspaper interviews.
2338	Hiatus and arrival of Anette Olzon (2006–2009)In order to find a replacement for Turunen as the female vocalist of the band, on March 17, 2006 the band allowed vocalists interested for the position to send in demo tapes as an audition for the spot.
2339	During this time, speculation began to emerge about who would eventually be chosen, and the band stated on their website that fans should not believe any source other than the band itself for information regarding the new vocalist.
2340	In the end, the 35-year-old Alyson Avenue's ex-lead singer, Anette Olzon, from Sweden, was chosen.
2341	In September 2006, the band entered the studio to record their sixth studio album, Dark Passion Play.
2342	In May, next year, Anette Olzon was announced to replace Turunen.
2343	Holopainen has said in interviews that he did not wish to reveal her identity until new material was available because he did not want fans judging her by nothing more than a picture, or past work.
2344	 The day after this revealing, May 25, 2007, charity single \\"Eva\\" was released for download only as the first offering from the new album, and the first featuring Olzon.
2345	It was originally scheduled for release on 30 May, but the date was changed because of a leak on a British music download site.
2346	On June 13, Nightwish revealed the title and artwork for the new album on their official website, as well as the name and cover of the second single (this time CD), \\"Amaranth\\"; it was released in Finland on August 22 and included a bonus track entitled \\"While Your Lips Are Still Red\\" written by Tuomas as the main theme track for the upcoming Finnish feature film \\"Lieksa!\\".
2347	The single achieved gold status in Finland after less than two days in stores.
2348	Nightwish at signing session in Hamburg, 2007 Dark Passion Play was released around Europe in the last week of September 2007, in the UK on October 1, and the United States on October 2.
2349	It was awarded double platinum in Finland the second day after its release and took the number one position on the charts of Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Hungary and Croatia and got in top 100 in other 16 countries, including the United States.
2350	On this album, male vocalist Marco Hietala had more freedom in the use of his voice: he sings back up in the songs \\"Cadence of Her Last Breath\\" and \\"Sahara\\", lead vocals in the songs \\"The Islander\\", \\"Master Passion Greed\\" and \\"While Your Lips Are Still Red\\", and chorus in the songs \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\" and \\"7 Days to the Wolves\\".
2351	He also sings one part in \\"The Poet and the Pendulum\\", besides singing back up in the chorus.
2352	Before the band found the new singer and the album was recorded, Marco sang on all the demo versions.
2353	Holopainen also sang on the demo versions of \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\" and \\"Master Passion Greed\\" but these songs have never been released.
2354	On September 22, 2007, the band hosted a secret concert at Rock Café in Tallinn, Estonia, disguising itself as a Nightwish cover band called \\"Nachtwasser\\".
2355	Their first official concert with Olzon was in Tel Aviv, Israel, on October 6, 2007.
2356	The Dark Passion Play tour thus started, visiting the United States, Canada, most of Europe, Asia, and Australia.
2357	Nightwish live in Paris, France, on April 6, 2008 The third single of the album was \\"Erämaan viimeinen\\", a previously unreleased vocal version of the instrumental \\"Last of the Wilds\\".
2358	It was released in Finland only on December 5, 2007.
2359	On this song, Jonsu of the Finnish pop and rock band Indica performs the Finnish vocals.
2360	\\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\", the fourth single, was released on February 15, 2008, and concerns the 2005 dismissal of Turunen, as does one other song on the album (Master Passion Greed).
2361	The single includes yet another bonus track, \\"Escapist\\", which is also included on the Japanese version of Dark Passion Play.
2362	Within a week after the release, the fifth single was announced to be \\"The Islander\\".
2363	It was released over a month after the release of its music video, shot in late 2007 in Rovaniemi in Finnish Lapland.
2364	The Dark Passion Play tour turned out to be Nightwish's longest tour yet, lasting from late 2007 to September 2009 when it ended with a concert in Hartwall Arena – the band's second concert there – with the band Apocalyptica.
2365	On March 6, 2009, Nightwish released a new live EP/DVD entitled Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places).
2366	The eight live tracks were recorded during the \\"Dark Passion Play World Tour\\" in 2007–2008, and the album also includes one b-side from the \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\" single, one b-side from the \\"Amaranth\\" single, a previously unreleased demo version of \\"Cadence of Her Last Breath\\", and a bonus-DVD with three music videos as well as a 37-minute documentary called Back in the Day is Now.
2367	Imaginaerum and Olzon's dismissal (2009–2012)In the June 2009 edition of the Finnish magazine Soundi, Holopainen stated that he had started work on a new Nightwish album.
2368	In October 2009, rumors about the new album's name were going around with the title Wind Embraced, but lead vocalist Anette Olzon listed the rumors as \\"not true\\" and said that the songs for the new album had not yet been completed apart from three songs written before May 2009.
2369	Holopainen said in a 2010 interview that \\"[...]I can't reveal to you any more but there is going to be a big twist so to say, on the next album.\\"
2370	In an interview with Uilleann pipist Troy Donockley (who recorded with the band on Dark Passion Play), when asked about his involvement in the new album, he stated \\"Oh yes, I will be playing on the next album and from what Tuomas has told me, it is going to be something extraordinary...\\"
2371	On February 1, 2010, Olzon stated on her blog that Holopainen had nine songs ready for the new album.
2372	In April 2010, Holopainen revealed on the Nightwish homepage that he had finished writing the songs, and on June 2, it was announced that he had finished recording the pre-production demo.
2373	The band announced in late 2010 that more information on the album's actual content would be released in late January, but on February 1, the official website bore a statement written by Holopainen that because of the schedule changes he can't yet give away as much details as he would have wanted, but more information will be out after a couple of months.
2374	He added, however, that \\"it still is the Burton-Gaiman-Dalí - amusement park we are about to enter\\"; In the same statement it was revealed that the album will be a theme album and \\"mood changes seem to be more present than ever before\\", and the orchestration demos he had received from Pip Williams were described as \\"beautiful, twisted, tribal and cinematic stuff\\".
2375	In the Finnish version of the statement, it was also revealed that a few songs will not get any orchestrations at all, differing from their latest album on which all songs had the background orchestra.
2376	Announcements continued throughout 2011.
2377	On February 10, Nightwish announced on their website that the new album title would be Imaginaerum.
2378	They also declared that the band had been preparing a movie based on the album, which would be released in 2012 and directed by Stobe Harju, who previously directed the music video for \\"The Islander\\".
2379	On August 22, 2011, it was announced on their official website that the album of Imaginaerum would be released at the end of the year.
2380	On August 31, Nightwish announced on their website their decision to change Imaginarium title to Imaginaerum \\"
2381	In order to avoid mix-ups with various things named 'Imaginarium'\\".
2382	Then on September 2, Nightwish announced on their website that the new single called \\"Storytime\\" will be released on Friday, November 11 and on September 9, Nightwish revealed the cover and tracklist.
2383	Nightwish performing with Elize Ryd and Alissa White-Gluz in Denver, Colorado, who filled in for Anette Olzon, who parted ways with the band afterwards.
2384	On January 11, 2012, Nightwish announced on their website that the second single \\"The Crow, the Owl and the Dove\\" would be released on February 29.
2385	Roadrunner Records announced that Nightwish would be releasing a 10-inch LP titled Trials of Imaginaerum in conjunction with Record Store Day  (April 21, 2012).
2386	The 10\\" LP is a two-sided picture disk, which contains four early demos of \\"Storytime\\", \\"The Crow, The Owl and The Dove\\", \\"I Want My Tears Back\\" and \\"Slow, Love, Slow\\".
2387	On October 1, 2012, Nightwish announced via their Facebook page that they were parting ways with Olzon.
2388	According to the press statement, \\"it has become increasingly obvious that the direction and the needs of the band were in conflict, and this has led to a division from which we cannot recover\\".
2389	This announcement came days after Olzon fell ill at a show in Denver, Colorado and was unable to perform.
2390	Nightwish used replacement singers from the opening band, Kamelot, and Olzon later expressed her disappointment, saying \\"I was never asked if it was OK that they used Elize and Alissa in the show [Friday] night [...]
2391	I don't think it's a good decision they made and I'm sorry for those of you who came to see the whole band but got something else.
2392	But I was very ill and this decision
2393	wasn't mine.\\"
2394	According to the statement, Dutch singer Floor Jansen (ex-After Forever, ReVamp) would sing for the remainder of the Imaginaerum World Tour.
2395	On January 11, 2013, Olzon announced on her official blog that she was pregnant with her third child, due in spring 2013.
2396	This was a contributing factor to her being dismissed.
2397	The band then released a statement on their website declaring that the reason Olzon gave for her dismissal and other statements she made were untrue and that Olzon herself had agreed to help find a replacement while she was on maternity leave.
2398	Later on, Olzon gave several interviews in which she told that she never agreed with a replacement, even when she was pregnant, and proposed to the band to postpone the tour, culminating on her firing.
2399	She also added that she was against Jansen joining the band in her period of maternity, mainly because of the difference in their vocal styles.
2400	In a 2015 interview, Holopainen said the band \\"emerged stronger\\" from the line-up changes it went through.
2401	Endless Forms Most Beautiful, arrival of Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley (2013–present)In an interview with Metal Hammer in November 2012, Tuomas Holopainen stated that they already had a rehearsal place booked from July 2014 to September 2014, but before they began rehearsing the band members would be taking a break from Nightwish for several months.
2402	On October 9, 2013, Nightwish announced Jansen as the permanent replacement for Olzon.
2403	Troy Donockley was also announced as a full-time member, making the band become a sextet for the first time.
2404	In a later interview, Tuomas said that because of Donockley's previous work with Nightwish already made him \\"much a band member\\", so the band just \\"made it official\\".
2405	According to the band's webpage, the band would enter the studio in 2014 to record their eighth full-length album for a 2015 release.
2406	At that time the band already announced that it would contain Nightwish's longest song to date.
2407	At the end of November, the band released the live album Showtime, Storytime.
2408	Despite the recording happening when they were only tour members, it is the first Nightwish release to feature Jansen, and to have her and Donockley credited as band members.
2409	The album also carries a documentary containing the behind-the-scenes of Jansen's first days in the band and the process of replacing Olzon.
2410	In May 2014, Tuomas updated his official website, stating that he and producer Tero \\"TeeCee\\" Kinnunen have been recording 12 demos (and possibly 3 bonus tracks) for the new album in Hattula, Finland.
2411	The band expected to start rehearsing in July in Eno, Finland, with the recording finished in January 2015, and the album released in Spring that year, \\"If everything goes as scheduled\\".
2412	Commenting on the music, Tuomas said:It's still too early to analyze the material more closely, but the album will once again explore all the ends of the spectrum, bringing the very best out of the newcomers' Floor and Troy.
2413	And stealthily the album ended up having a theme running through it.
2414	On August 6, the band announced that founding member and drummer Jukka Nevalainen would not be part of the upcoming album due to his very difficult insomnia.
2415	Kai Hahto (Wintersun) would be taking his place in the album and the upcoming tour.
2416	Evolutionary biologist and author Richard Dawkins was announced as a guest star on the album, with Holopainen stating that he had \\"been so enthusiastic about this kind of literature for the past few months, and will be for the upcoming months, that it's going to come out somehow.
2417	\\"Nightwish performing in Oberhausen, Germany, in November 2015 In November, the band filmed a music video for \\"Élan\\", one of the tracks of the album.
2418	On December 8, the band announced that it would be the first single from the album, which would be released on February 13, 2015.
2419	The new album's cover art and its title, Endless Forms Most Beautiful, were revealed on December 22, and the album was released on March 27, 2015.
2420	Produced by Tero \\"TeeCee\\" Kinnunen, the title for Endless Forms Most Beautiful was taken from the writings of English naturalist Charles Darwin.
2421	The album features the participation of London's The Metro Voices choir group, London's Young Musicians Children‘s Choir, and the Orchestre De Grandeur led by the esteemed orchestral arranger Pip Williams, who teaches Music and Music Technology at the London College of Music.
2422	Professor Richard Dawkins not only narrates the introduction to the album's opener, \\"Shudder Before the Beautiful,\\" but also the album's closer, \\"The Greatest Show on Earth,\\" which takes its name from his 2009 book on evolution.
2423	The album sold in its first week 18,342 copies in the US and debuted at 34 on the Billboard 200, making it Nightwish's third album (after Dark Passion Play and Imaginaerum) to chart in this category.
2424	In the Czech Republic, the album debuted atop the charts and received gold-status after just two days.
2425	The album charted in top 10 in other countries as well, including Finland, Netherlands, Poland, Austria, and Mexico.
2426	In the support of album's release the band embarked on an Endless Forms Most Beautiful World Tour, which started on April 9, 2015 in New York, USA and ended on October 9, 2016 in Saitama, Japan.
2427	In July 2015, it was announced that Sonata Arctica's vocalist Tony Kakko would replace Jukka Nevalainen as the band's special guest at the 2015 edition of Rock in Rio.
2428	In December 2015, they became the first Finnish band to headline a show at the Wembley Arena, in London.
2429	The sold-out show had the guest performance of Richard Dawkins, who spoke his parts on stage.
2430	The Tampere and London shows were filmed for a live album release known as Vehicle of Spirit.
2431	On August 20, 2016, the band played a special 20th-anniversary show at Himos Areena in Finland.
2432	The show featured original bassist Sami Vänskä on the song \\"Stargazers\\" and drummer Jukka Nevalainen on the song \\"Last Ride of the Day\\".
2433	The band took a break in 2017, in which Jansen was focusing on her first child.
2434	Holopainen has said that the band will continue between the years of 2018 and 2020, with another album that will continue the themes explored in Endless Forms Most Beautiful.

2436	On June 9, 2017, the band announced that March 9, 2018, would mark both the debut of a nine-month world tour titled Decades: World Tour, which had concluded in December that same year, and the release of a new compilation album, titled Decades.
2437	The tour featured \\"rarely heard material\\" and a special set for fans; on the US and Canadian portion of the tour, every audience member was offered the Decades album for free.
2438	During the Latin American leg of the tour, the São Paulo and Buenos Aires shows were filmed for a live DVD.
2439	In July 2018, Holopainen stated that he had written \\"80 or 90%\\" of the material for Nightwish's next album, which would consist of ten or eleven songs; he stated that the inspiration for a new album came from the completion of the 2018 self-titled debut album of Auri, a band he created with Donockley and Johanna Kurkela the previous year.
2440	Recording will start in July 2019, for a planned Spring 2020 release.
2441	The band will \\"use the [orchestral] instrumentation in a different way than before\\", with Holopainen stating \\"You want to search for some new ways of using it so that it doesn't end up sounding the same as before.\\"
2442	Jansen stated in November that she believed the recording process would be similar to Endless Forms Most Beautiful's, for which the band went through lengthy rehearsals before starting to record.
2443	MusicMusical styleThe use of keyboard through traditional piano and strings to create a gothic atmosphere is an important part of Nightwish's original music.
2444	Earlier Nightwish performs symphonic metal with soaring female operatic vocals.
2445	Their music has been described as \\"bombastic heavy, symphonic and cinematic, with keyboards and strings creating a gothic atmosphere\\".
2446	They have also been known to play power metal and gothic metal.
2447	The band's music is also known to be complex and layered.
2448	Their approach is epic, theatrical and operatic.
2449	Critic Chad Bowar notes that the music is \\"always very melodic with memorable choruses and a lot of hooks.\\"A part of Nightwish's original sound was the soprano vocals of Tarja Turunen, until her departure from the band in 2005.
2450	The usage of a female vocalist has become a sort of trademark, though less so since the outbreak of new female fronted metal bands in the mid-2000s with the popularization of bands such as Evanescence and Within Temptation as well as several gothic metal bands mixing female and male vocals, such as Lacuna Coil, Tristania, Epica and After Forever.
2451	Bassist and vocalist Marco Hietala describes the style of the band's music as \\"melodic symphonic metal;\\" though this is not a view shared by all members of the group, including band composer Tuomas Holopainen, who describes the band as simply symphonic metal.
2452	Some critics find that the band had a gothic sound since their debut.
2453	The music of Nightwish had been \\"distinguished by the operatic voice\\" of soprano Tarja Turunen, a \\"charismatic frontwoman with a powerful voice\\".
2454	Critics observed that her vocals became less operatic with the release of Once.
2455	Following the departure of Tarja Turunen from the group, Nightwish left behind the \\"signature operatic vocals\\" of their earlier albums.
2456	While the music of Nightwish is centered around a female lead singer, the band has also featured some male vocals on their albums ever since their debut release Angels Fall First.
2457	This debut album also included \\"elements of folk music and ambience\\" that were discarded on their subsequent album Oceanborn.
2458	However, the song \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\" from the album \\"Once\\" featured some use of folk-oriented Native American melodies, and their 2007 release Dark Passion Play featured folk music elements on the songs \\"The Islander\\" and \\"Last of the Wilds\\".
2459	Lyrical themesIn the beginning, Holopainen mainly wrote about mythological and fantasy themes, and often used references to \\"metaphysics and nature\\".
2460	Fantasy novels especially are a big influence on Nightwish's lyrics.
2461	Songs such as \\"Wishmaster,\\" \\"Elvenpath,\\" and \\"Wanderlust\\" make fairly clear references to fantasy novels, in this case the Dragonlance series and J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.
2462	\\"FantasMic\\" from Wishmaster is a direct tribute to Walt Disney and Disney animated films, which Holopainen has said are among his influences.
2463	Dark Passion Play featured the return to the fantasy theme with songs such as \\"Sahara\\", \\"Whoever Brings the Night\\" and \\"7 Days to the Wolves\\", which is loosely based on Stephen King's novel Wolves of the Calla, the fifth book in the Dark Tower series.
2464	The song The Poet and the Pendulum's first section is called \\"The White Lands of Empathica\\", which is a reference to the seventh book in the Dark Tower series.
2465	Through the years, the lyrics became more personal.
2466	\\"Dead Boy's Poem\\" from Wishmaster is a very emotional piece, which Holopainen calls his \\"legacy and [...] testament for the whole world.
2467	[...] I wanted to do this song before I die because I wanted to tell the whole world what I think and feel.
2468	It expresses a lot of myself.\\"
2469	The personal development became even more obvious on the Wishmaster-successor Century Child.
2470	Turunen thinks that the lyrics do not anymore deal \\"with the dreamland we were used to, but with the brutal reality of life.
2471	\\"\\"Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan\\" (in English, \\"Death Makes an Artist\\") from Once describes the experience of loss and its impact on art, \\"Nemo\\" deals with the feeling of being lost, while \\"Dead Gardens\\" deals with a bout of artist's block Holopainen suffered from.
2472	\\"Creek Mary's Blood\\" is based on Dee Brown's story of the same name, which presents the situation of Native Americans at the end of the 19th century.
2473	2007's Dark Passion Play included an unusual amount of personal songs, including \\"The Poet and the Pendulum\\" which has been described as Holopainen's life story, and about being a composer and musician.
2474	Another song, \\"Meadows of Heaven\\" is a depiction of Holopainen's childhood and the feeling that it'll never return.
2475	Two songs, \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\" and \\"Master Passion Greed\\" are about ex-member Tarja Turunen and her husband Marcelo Cabuli.
2476	Another song on the album, \\"Cadence of Her Last Breath\\", is a \\"very personal song\\" about running away.
2477	The album also contains many references to authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Walt Whitman.
2478	Imaginaerum tracks has different lyrical themes: for example, a song \\"Ghost River\\" themed battle between the Devil and Mother Gaia while \\"Scaretale\\" themed childhood nightmares.
2479	On Endless Forms Most Beautiful lyrical themes included songs about \\"the beauty of the world and everything it has to offer\\" (\\"Shudder Before The Beautiful\\"), critic about how some religions restrict people lives (\\"Weak Fantasy\\"),  and \\"the meaning of life, which can be something different for all of us\\" (Élan).
2480	Although the lyrics of Nightwish generally are serious with dark meanings, they have also produced several less serious songs, including the bonus track \\"Nightquest\\", which talks about the band members' (the three original members as well as Nevalainen) connection as musicians, and the \\"quest\\" of Nightwish.
2481	LanguageNightwish's debut album Angels Fall First had one song in the Finnish language, but since then the band has only written songs in English, with the only exceptions being \\"Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan\\" from the Once album (2004), the single \\"Erämaan viimeinen\\" (2007), which is a vocal version of the instrumental \\"Last of the Wilds\\", and \\"Taikatalvi\\" (\\"Magic Winter\\") from Imaginaerum (2011).
2482	Holopainen thought that he was very uncertain about the lyrics of \\"Erämaan viimeinen\\", because he is of the opinion that writing in Finnish is rather hard, and has said that \\"Finnish [could] quickly sound really cheesy.\\"InfluenceTuomas Holopainen, writer of most of the band's lyrics and music, says that he gets most of the inspiration for Nightwish's songs from film music.
2483	Songs like \\"Beauty of the Beast\\" (from Century Child), \\"Ghost Love Score\\" (from Once) and \\"The Poet and the Pendulum\\" (from Dark Passion Play) are examples of this influence.
2484	Holopainen has also said that film music is the music he listens to for leisure.
2485	He likes, for example, the musical scores to The Village, Van Helsing, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Crimson Tide, and practically everything written by Hans Zimmer.
2486	Other songs, such as \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\" (from Dark Passion Play), and \\"Wish I Had an Angel\\" (from Once) have elements of industrial metal, and some others, like \\"The Islander\\" and \\"Last of the Wilds\\" (from Dark Passion Play), \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\" (from Once), and the Angels Fall First album have elements of folk music.
2487	Bands stated as an influence on Nightwish include Children of Bodom, Theatre of Tragedy, The Gathering, My Dying Bride, Tiamat and The 3rd and the Mortal.
2488	Nightwish has also been noted as a source of inspiration for other bands.
2489	Simone Simons, lead singer of Dutch symphonic/gothic metal band Epica, stated that she began singing because of Nightwish's 1998 Oceanborn album.
2490	Sander Gommans of After Forever said that Nightwish \\"will certainly influence us in creating new songs\\".
2491	Power metal band Sonata Arctica's lead singer Tony Kakko has explained how much of an influence Nightwish is to him.
2492	In December 2015, Metal Hammer's Dave Everley described them as \\"mainland Europe's most successful metal band, give or take a Rammstein\\".

2513	CoralineCoraline.jpgFront cover by Dave McKeanNeil GaimanDave McKean
2514	Dave MckeanUnited KingdomEnglishDark fantasyBloomsbury (UK)Harper Collins (US)24 February 2002Print, e-book, audiobook1638130-06-113937-871822484PZ7.G1273 Co 2002Coraline  is a dark fantasy children's novella by British author Neil Gaiman, published in 2002 by Bloomsbury and Harper Collins.
2515	It was awarded the 2003 Hugo Award for Best Novella, the 2003 Nebula Award for Best Novella, and the 2002 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers.
2516	The titular character's name came from a typo in \\"Caroline\\".
2517	According to Gaiman, \\"I had typed the name Caroline, and it came out wrong.
2518	I looked at the word Coraline, and knew it was someone's name.
2519	I wanted to know what happened to her.\\"
2520	It has been compared to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and has been adapted into a 2009 stop-motion film, directed by Henry Selick.
2521	PlotCoraline Jones and her parents move into an old house that has been divided into flats.
2522	The other tenants include Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, two elderly women retired from the stage and Mr. Bobinsky (Originally Mr. Bobo in this book), initially referred to as \\"the crazy old man upstairs\\", who claims to be training a mouse circus.
2523	The flat beside Coraline's is unoccupied, and a small door that links them is revealed to be bricked up when opened.
2524	Coraline goes to visit her new neighbours.
2525	Mr. Bobinsky relays to her a message from his mice: \\"Don't go through the door.\\"
2526	Coraline also has tea with Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, and Miss Spink spies danger in Coraline’s future after reading her tea leaves.
2527	Later, when Coraline's parents go missing due to the other mother taking them, Miss Spink then gives her a lucky stone with a hole in the middle, which is supposed to be \\"good for bad things\\", but Miss Forcible says it's, \\"good for lost things\\".
2528	Despite these warnings, Coraline decides to unlock the door when she is home by herself.
2529	This time, she finds the brick wall behind the door is gone.
2530	In its place is a long hallway that leads to a flat identical to her own, except inhabited by the \\"Other Mother\\" and \\"Other Father,\\" who have black buttons for eyes.
2531	The Other Mother is notably taller and thinner than her real mother.
2532	Her black hair seems to move by itself, her skin is paper-white, and her nails are long and red.
2533	Coraline finds the \\"Other World\\" more interesting than her own; the Other Mother cooks food that she actually enjoys, both of her Other Parents pay more attention to her, her toy box is filled with animate toys that can move and fly, the Other Miss Spink and Miss Forcible perform a never-ending act in their flat, and the Other Mr. Bobinsky performs a mice circus.
2534	She even finds that the feral black cat that wanders around the house in the real world can talk.
2535	The cat identifies itself as the same cat that lives in the real world, and possesses the ability to travel through the gaps between the two worlds.
2536	Although intentionally rude and unhelpful for the greater part of the conversation, it briefly praises her for bringing \\"protection\\", then vanishes.
2537	After Coraline returns to the copy of her flat, the Other Mother offers Coraline the opportunity to stay in the Other World forever, but in order to do so, Coraline must allow buttons to be sewn into her eyes.
2538	Coraline is horrified and returns through the door to her home.
2539	Upon return to her apartment, Coraline finds that her real parents are missing.
2540	They do not return the next day, and the black cat wakes her and takes her to a mirror in her hallway, through which she can see her trapped parents.
2541	They signal to her by writing \\"Help Us\\" on the glass, from which Coraline deduces the Other Mother has kidnapped them.
2542	Though frightened of returning, Coraline goes back to the Other World to confront the Other Mother and rescue her parents.
2543	In the garden, Coraline is prompted by the cat to challenge the Other Mother, as \\"her kind of thing loves games and challenges.\\"
2544	The Other Mother tries to convince Coraline to stay, but Coraline refuses, and is locked within a small space behind a mirror as punishment.
2545	In the small dark closet space, she meets three ghost children.
2546	Each had in the past let the Other Mother, who they archaically refer to as the \\"beldam ,\\" sew buttons over their eyes.
2547	They tell Coraline how the Other Mother eventually grew bored with them, leaving them to die and cast them aside, but they are trapped there because she has kept their souls.
2548	If their souls can be rescued from the Other Mother, then the ghosts can pass on.
2549	The ghost children implore Coraline to escape and avoid their fate.
2550	After the Other Mother releases Coraline from the mirror, Coraline proposes a game: if she can find the ghost children's souls and her parents, then she, her parents, and the ghost children may go free.
2551	If she loses, then Coraline will let the Other Mother sew the buttons into her eyes and become a loving daughter to her.
2552	The Other Mother agrees and they both swear on their right hands.
2553	Coraline searches through the Other World and overcomes the Other Mother's obstacles by using her wits and Miss Spink's lucky stone to find the marble-like souls of the ghost children.
2554	She also deduces that her parents are imprisoned in a snow globe on the mantelpiece.
2555	The ghost children warn her that even if Coraline wins, the Other Mother will not let them go, so Coraline tricks the Other Mother by announcing that she knows where her parents are hidden: in the passageway between the worlds.
2556	The Other Mother cannot resist gloating by opening the door to show Coraline that her parents are not there.
2557	When the Other Mother opens the door Coraline throws the cat at the Other Mother, grabs the snow globe, and escapes to the real world with the key, and the cat quickly follows.
2558	While escaping, Coraline forces the door shut on the Other Mother's hand.
2559	Back in her home, Coraline falls asleep on a chair.
2560	She is awoken by her parents who have no memory of the events.
2561	That night, Coraline has a dream in which she meets the three children at a picnic.
2562	The children are dressed in clothes from different periods and one seems to have wings.
2563	They warn her that her task is still not done: the Other Mother will attempt to get her back and will try to get the key to open the door between the worlds.
2564	Coraline goes to the old well in the woods to dispose of the key.
2565	She pretends to have a picnic, with the picnic blanket laid over the entrance to the well.
2566	The Other Mother's severed hand attempts to seize the key, but steps on the blanket and falls into the well.
2567	Coraline returns to the house, greeting her neighbours (who finally get her name right), and getting ready for school tomorrow.
2568	CharactersCoraline Jones – The young explorer.
2569	She is curious, intelligent, resourceful, and courageous.
2570	Coraline is often irritated by rain, crazy grown-ups (as they all seem to be), and not being taken seriously because of her young age.
2571	She's described as being \\"small for her age\\", but Coraline is not afraid to face anyone; she is the most adventurous person in the book.
2572	Mrs. Jones – Coraline's mother.
2573	She is very busy most of the time, and sometimes a little inattentive, but she loves and cares about Coraline.
2574	She is nice, and helpful, though Coraline considers her to be rather boring.
2575	Coraline also gets annoyed with her real mother because she doesn't seem to want to let Coraline \\"fit in\\".
2576	In the film, her first name is Mel.
2577	Mr. Jones – Coraline's father.
2578	He works at his house on the computer.
2579	He cares about Coraline very much and is kind, brave, and helpful.
2580	He makes interesting food creations that Coraline strongly dislikes.
2581	He, too, is usually too busy to spend time with Coraline.
2582	In the film, his first name is Charlie.
2583	The Cat – A black cat from Coraline's world.
2584	The cat acts as a mentor to Coraline and guides her through her journey.
2585	It claims to have no name, explaining that cats do not need names to tell each other apart.
2586	Unlike many of the characters in the novel, it does not have an \\"Other World\\" counterpart, saying that unlike other creatures in the world, cats can \\"keep themselves together\\".
2587	It moves freely from one world to the other, although it seems to be only able to talk in the Other World.
2588	It is very sarcastic, though helpful to Coraline.
2589	It's defiant of the Other Mother, but seems to tremble at the thought of being stuck in the Other Mother's world.
2590	It befriends Coraline and helps her escape from the Other Mother, though Coraline also uses it as a weapon without its permission.
2591	The Other Mother – The creature that created much of the Other World and the main villain of the novel.
2592	She looks similar to Coraline's real mother but taller and thinner, with long black hair that seems to move by itself, black button eyes, paper-white skin, and extremely long, twitchy fingers with long dark red nails.
2593	 During the course of the novel, she grows taller, thinner, and paler, looking less and less like Coraline's mother.
2594	She cannot create, but only copy, twist and change things from the real world when constructing her version of it.
2595	She collects children, whom she loves possessively to the point of eventual destruction.
2596	She mainly wants someone to mother.
2597	It's implied that she killed her own mother because when Coraline asked her if she had a grave she replied \\"Oh yes, I put her there myself.\\"
2598	In the film her true form is a skeletal-arachnoid creature.
2599	She is referred to several times as \\"the beldam \\", a Middle English word meaning \\"grandmother\\", \\"ugly old woman\\", \\"hag\\", or \\"witch\\", and also used to refer to creatures of fairy.
2600	The Other Father – A creation of the Other Mother, the Other Father is used to help trick Coraline into staying in the Other Mother's world.
2601	Like her real father, he has a study and sits there during the day and will not talk to Coraline for long.
2602	He does not work, however; he merely occupies the study, as he is not permitted to talk to Coraline by himself.
2603	He is much more fun than Coraline's real father and always tries to be cheerful and fun in front of Coraline.
2604	In reality, the Other Father is sad and nervous.
2605	The Other Mother ends up punishing him for revealing too much to Coraline—she transforms him into a grub-like creature, and orders the Other Father to trap Coraline so she cannot win her challenge, but Coraline escapes.
2606	Miss Spink and Miss Forcible – A pair of retired actresses who live in the flat under Coraline's.
2607	They own many ageing Scotties, such as Hamish, Angus, and Jock, and talk in theater jargon, often referencing their time as actresses.
2608	They recognize the danger Coraline is in after reading her fortune through tea leaves and give her a stone with a hole in it to help protect her.
2609	In the Other World they are young, pretty, and perform continuously in front of many different dogs, who, in the Other World, are anthropomorphic.
2610	Mr. Bobo – A retired circus performer living in the flat above Coraline's; he is commonly referred to as the Crazy Old Man Upstairs.
2611	Over the course of the book he claims to be training mice to perform in a mouse circus, and often brings Coraline messages from them, though at first Coraline doubts he even has mice to train, and doesn't listen to what he says to be messages from the mice.
2612	His counterpart in the Other World trains rats, and is in fact made of rats.
2613	(In the film adaptation, this character is named Mr. Bobinsky.)
2614	The three ghost children – The spirits of three children who were previous victims of the Other Mother: two girls and one boy.
2615	The boy is described as having a dirty face and red trousers.
2616	One of the girls has brown hair, a pink blouse and a pink skirt.
2617	The other has a brown bonnet and brown dress.
2618	They were trapped by the other mother at different times before Coraline, and reside in the dark space behind the mirror.
2619	After having their souls restored, they go to the afterlife, but not before meeting Coraline for a last time, in a dream where she picnics with them.
2620	Here, she sees their true appearances and they thank her for freeing them from the Other Mother.
2621	They also warn her that the other mother is not done with her.

2644	It is located in the department of Yvelines, in the region of Île-de-France, about  southwest of the centre of Paris.
2645	The palace is now a Monument historique and UNESCO World Heritage site, notable especially for the ceremonial Hall of Mirrors, the jewel-like Royal Opera, and the royal apartments; for the more intimate royal residences, the Grand Trianon and Petit Trianon located within the park; the small rustic Hameau (Hamlet) created for Marie Antoinette; and the vast Gardens of Versailles with fountains, canals, and geometric flower beds and groves, laid out by André le Nôtre.
2646	The Palace was stripped of all its furnishings after the French Revolution, but many pieces have been returned and many of the palace rooms have been restored.
2647	In 2017 the Palace of Versailles received 7,700,000 visitors, making it the second-most visited monument in the Île-de-France region, just behind the Louvre and ahead of the Eiffel Tower.

2650	 The palace in 1668 during the first reconstruction.
2651	(Painting by Pierre Patel) The facade of the palace facing the garden in 1675.
2652	The terrace was replaced by the Hall of Mirrors The site of the Palace was first occupied by a small village and church, surrounded by forests filled with abundant game.
2653	It was owned by the Gondi family and the priory of Saint Julian.
2654	King Henry IV went hunting there in 1589, and returned in 1604 and 1609, staying in the village inn.
2655	His son, the future Louis XIII, came on his own hunting trip there in 1607.
2656	After he became King in 1610, Louis XIII returned to the village, bought some land, and in 1623-24 built a modest two-story hunting lodge the site of the current marble courtyard.
2657	He was staying there in November 1630 during the event known as the Day of the Dupes, when the enemies of the King's chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu, aided by the King's mother, Marie de' Medici, tried to take over the government.
2658	The King defeated the plot and sent his mother into exile.
2659	After this event, Louis XIII decided to make his hunting lodge at Versailles into a château.
2660	The King purchased the surrounding territory from the Gondi family, and in 1631–1634 had the architect Philibert Le Roy replace the hunting lodge with a château of brick and stone with classical pilasters in the doric style and high slate-covered roofs, surrounding the courtyard of the original hunting lodge.
2661	The gardens and park were also enlarged, laid out by Jacques Boyceau and his nephew, Jacques de Menours (1591–1637), and reached essentially the size they have today.
2662	The palace of Louis XIVLouis XIV first visited the château on a hunting trip in 1651 at the age of twelve, but returned only occasionally until his marriage to Maria Theresa of Spain in 1660 and the death of Cardinal Mazarin in 1661, after which he suddenly acquired a passion for the site.
2663	He decided to rebuild, embellish and enlarge the château and to transform it into a setting for both rest and for elaborate entertainments on a grand scale.
2664	The first phase of the expansion (c. 1661–1678) was designed and supervised by the architect Louis Le Vau.
2665	Initially he added two wings to the forecourt, one for servants quarters and kitchens, the other for stables.
2666	In 1668 he added three new wings built of stone, known as the envelope, to the north, south and west (the garden side) of the original château.
2667	These buildings had nearly-flat roofs covered with lead.
2668	The king also commissioned the landscape designer André Le Nôtre to create the most magnificent gardens in Europe, embellished with fountains, statues, basins, canals, geometric flower beds and groves of trees.
2669	He also added two grottos in the Italian style and an immense orangerie to house fruit trees, as well as a zoo with a central pavilion for exotic animals.
2670	After Le Vau's death in 1670, the work was taken over and completed by his assistant François d'Orbay.
2671	The main floor (above the ground floor) of the new palace contained two symmetrical sets of apartments, one for the king and the other for the queen, looking over the gardens.
2672	The two apartments were separated by a marble terrace, overlooking the garden, with a fountain in the center.
2673	Each set of apartments was connected to the ground floor with a ceremonial stairway, and each had seven rooms, aligned in a row; a vestibule, a room for the guards, an antechamber, chamber, a large cabinet or office; a smaller bedroom, and a smaller cabinet.
2674	On the ground floor under the King's apartment was another apartment, the same size, designed for his private life, and decorated on the theme of Apollo, the Sun god, his personal emblem.
2675	Under the Queen's apartment was the apartment of the Grand Dauphin, the heir to the throne.
2676	The interior decoration was assigned to Charles Le Brun.
2677	Le Brun supervised the work of a large group of sculptors and painters, called the Petite Academie, who crafted and painted the ornate walls and ceilings.
2678	Le Brun also supervised the design and installation of countless statues in the gardens.
2679	The grand stairway to the King's apartment was soon redecorated almost as soon as it was completed with plaques of colored marble and trophies of arms, tapestries, and balconies, so the members of the court could observe the processions of the King.
2680	In 1670, Le Vau added a new pavilion northwest of the chateau, called the Trianon, for the King's relaxation in the hot summers.
2681	It was surrounded by flowerbeds and decorated entirely with blue and white porcelain, in imitation of the Chinese style.
2682	Enlargement of the Palace (1678-1715)
2683	The King increasingly spent his days in Versailles, and the government, court, and courtiers, numbering six to seven thousand persons, crowded into the buildings.
2684	The King ordered a further enlargement, which he entrusted to the young architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart.
2685	Hadouin-Mansart added two large new wings on either side of the original Cour Royale (Royal Courtyard).
2686	He also replaced Le Vau's large terrace, facing the garden on the west, with what became the most famous room of the palace, the Hall of Mirrors.
2687	Mansart also built the Petites Écuries and Grandes Écuries (stables) across the Place d'Armes, on the eastern side of the château.
2688	The King wished a quiet place to relax away from the ceremony of the Court.
2689	In 1687 Hardouin-Mansart began the Grand Trianon, or Trianon de Marbre (Marble Trianon), replacing Le Vau's 1668 Trianon de Porcelaine in the northern section of the park.
2690	In 1682 Louis XIV was able to proclaim Versailles his principal residence and the seat of the government and was able to give rooms in the palace to almost all of his courtiers.
2691	After the death of Maria Theresa of Spain in 1683, Louis XIV undertook the enlargement and remodeling of the royal apartments in the original part of the palace, within the former hunting lodge built by his father.
2692	He instructed Mansart to begin the construction of the Royal Chapel of Versailles, which towered over the rest of the palace.
2693	Hardouin-Mansart died in 1708 and so the chapel was completed by his assistant Robert de Cotte in 1710.
2694	The Palace of Louis XVA masked ball in the Hall of Mirrors (1745) by Nicolas Cochin Louis XIV died in 1715, and the young new King, Louis XV, just five years old, and his government were moved temporarily from Versailles to Paris under the regency of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans.
2695	In 1722, when the King came of age, he moved his residence and the government back to Versailles, where it remained until the French Revolution in 1789.
2696	Louis XV remained faithful to the original plan of his great-grandfather, and made few changes to the exteriors of Versailles.
2697	His main contributions were the construction of the Salon of Hercules, which connected the main building of the Palace with the north wing and the chapel (1724–36); and the royal opera theater, designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel, and built between 1769 and 1770.
2698	The new theater was completed in time for the celebration of the wedding of the Dauphin, the future Louis XVI, and Archduchess Marie Antoinette of Austria.
2699	He also made numerous additions and changes to the royal apartments, where he, the Queen, his daughters, and his heir lived.
2700	In 1738, Louis XV remodeled the king's petit appartement on the north side of the Cour de Marbre, originally the entrance court of the old château.
2701	He discreetly provided accommodations in another part of the palace for his famous mistresses, Madame de Pompadour and later Madame du Barry.
2702	The extension of the King's petit appartement necessitated the demolition of the Ambassador's Staircase, one of the most admired features of Louis XIV's palace, which left the Palace without a grand staircase entrance.
2703	The following year Louis XV ordered the demolition of the north wing facing onto the Cour Royale, which had fallen into serious disrepair.
2704	He commissioned Gabriel to rebuild it in a more neoclassical style.
2705	The new wing was completed in 1780.
2706	Louis XVI, and the Palace during the RevolutionLouis XVI and Marie Antoinette, with Lafayette, face the angry crowd from their balcony at Versailles, October 6, 1789 Louis XVI was constrained by the worsening financial situation of the kingdom from making major changes to the palace, so that he primarily focused on improvements to the royal apartments.
2707	Louis XVI gave Marie Antoinette the Petit Trianon in 1774.
2708	The Queen made extensive changes to the interior, and added a theater, the Théâtre de la Reine.
2709	She also totally transformed the arboretum planted during the reign of Louis XV into what became known as the Hameau de la Reine.
2710	This was a picturesque collection of buildings modeled after a rural French hamlet, where the Queen and her courtiers could play at being peasants.
2711	The Queen was at the Petit Trianon in 1789 when she first learned of the beginning of the French Revolution in July 1789.
2712	In 1783, the Palace was the site of the signing of three treaties of the Peace of Paris (1783), in which the United Kingdom recognized the independence of the United States.
2713	The King and Queen learned of the storming of the Bastille in Paris on July 14, 1789.
2714	while they were at the Palace, and remained isolated there as the Revolution in Paris spread.
2715	The growing anger in Paris led to the Women's March on Versailles on 5 October 1789.
2716	A crowd of several thousand men and women, protesting the high price and scarcity of bread, marched from the markets of Paris to Versailles.
2717	They took weapons from the city armory, besieged the Palace, and compelled the King and Royal family and the members of the National Assembly to return with them to Paris the following day.
2718	As soon as the royal family departed, the Palace was closed, awaiting their return.
2719	In 1792, the Convention, the new revolutionary government, ordered the transfer of all the paintings and sculptures from the Palace to the Louvre.
2720	In 1793, the Convention declared the abolition of the monarchy, and ordered all of the royal property in the Palace to be sold at auction.
2721	The auction took place between 25 August 1793 and 11 August 1794.
2722	The furnishings and art of the Palace, including the furniture, mirrors, baths and kitchen equipment, were sold in seventeen thousand lots.
2723	All fleurs-de-lys and royal emblems on the buildings were chambered or chiseled off.
2724	The empty buildings were turned into a storehouse for furnishings, art and libraries confiscated from the nobility.
2725	The empty grand apartments were opened for tours beginning in 1793, and a small museum of French paintings and art school was opened in some of the empty rooms.
2726	19th century - history museum and government venueBanquet for Queen Victoria hosted by Napoleon III in the Royal Opera of Versailles,
2727	August 1855  Proclamation of the German Empire, 18 January 1871, 1877 by Anton von Werner When Napoleon Bonaparte became Emperor of the French in 1804, he considered making Versailles his residence, but abandoned the idea because of the cost of the renovation.
2728	Prior to his marriage with Marie-Louise in 1810, he had the Grand Trianon restored and refurnished as a springtime residence for himself and his family, in the style of furnishing that it is seen today.
2729	In 1815, with the final downfall of Napoleon, Louis XVIII, the younger brother of Louis XVI, became King, and considered returning the royal residence to Versailles, where he had been born.
2730	He ordered the restoration of the royal apartments, but the task and cost was too great.
2731	Neither he nor his successor Charles X lived at Versailles.
2732	The French Revolution of 1830 brought a new monarch, Louis-Philippe to power, and a new ambition for Versailles.
2733	He did not reside at Versailles, but began the creation of the Museum of the History of France, dedicated to \\"all the glories of France\\", located in the south wing of the Palace, which had been used to house some members of the royal family.
2734	The museum was begun in 1833 and inaugurated on 30 June 1837.
2735	Its most famous room is the Galerie des Batailles (Hall of Battles), which lies on most of the length of the second floor.
2736	Louis Philippe had the far end of the south wing of the Cour Royale demolished and rebuilt to match the Gabriel wing of 1780 opposite, which gave greater uniformity of appearance to the front entrance.
2737	The museum project largely came to a halt when Louis Philippe was overthrown in 1848, though the paintings of French heroes and great battles still remain in the south wing.
2738	Emperor Napoleon III used the Palace on occasion as a stage for grand ceremonies.
2739	One of the most lavish was the banquet that he hosted for Queen Victoria in the Royal Opera of Versailles on August 25, 1855.
2740	During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, the Palace was occupied by the general staff of the victorious German Army.
2741	Parts of the chateau, including the Gallery of Mirrors, were turned into a military hospital.
2742	The creation of the German Empire, combining Prussia and the surrounding German states under William I, was formally proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors on January 18, 1871.
2743	The Germans remained in the Palace until the signing of the armistice in March 1871.
2744	In that month, the government of the new Third French Republic, which had departed Paris during the War for Tours and then Bordeaux, moved into the Palace.
2745	The National Assembly held its meetings in the Opera House.
2746	The uprising of the Paris Commune in May, 1871, prevented the French government, under Adolphe Thiers, from returning immediately to Paris.
2747	The military operation which suppressed the Commune at the end of the month was directed from Versailles, and the prisoners of the Commune were marched there and put on trial in military courts.
2748	In 1875 a second parliamentary body, the French Senate, was created, and held its meetings for the election of a President of the Republic in a new hall created in 1876 in the south wing of the Palace.
2749	The French Senate continues to meet in the Palace on special occasions, such as the amendment of the French Constitution.
2750	20th centuryThe Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles, 28 June 1919 by William Orpen The end of the 19th and the early 20th century saw the beginning of restoration efforts at the Palace, first led by Pierre de Nolhac, poet and scholar and the first conservator, who began his work in 1892.
2751	The conservation and restoration was interrupted by two world wars, but has continued until the present day.
2752	The Palace briefly returned to the world stage in June, 1919, when the Treaty of Versailles, formally ending the First World War, was signed in the Hall of Mirrors.
2753	Between 1925 and 1928, the American philanthropist and multi-millionaire John D. Rockefeller gave $2,166,000, the equivalent of about thirty million dollars today, to restore and refurnish the palace.
2754	More work took place after World War II, with the restoration of the Royal Opera of Versailles.
2755	The theater was reopened in 1957, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain.
2756	In 1978, parts of the Palace were heavily damaged in a bombing committed by Breton terrorists.
2757	The restoration initiatives launched by the Fifth Republic have proven to be perhaps more costly than the expenditures of the palace in the Ancien Régime.
2758	Starting in the 1950s, when the museum of Versailles was under the directorship of Gérald van der Kemp, the objective was to restore the palace to its state – or as close to it as possible – in 1789 when the royal family left the palace.
2759	Among the early projects was the repair of the roof over the Hall of Mirrors; the publicity campaign brought international attention to the plight of post-war Versailles and garnered much foreign money including a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.
2760	Concurrently, in the Soviet Union (Russia since 26 December 1991), the restoration of the Pavlovsk Palace located 25 kilometers from the center of Leningrad – today's Saint Petersburg – brought the attention of French Ministry of Culture, including that of the curator of Versailles.
2761	After the war when Soviet authorities were restoring the palace, which had been gutted by the retreating Nazi forces, they recreated the silk fabrics by using preserved 18th-century remnants.
2762	When these results and the high quality achieved were brought to the attention of the French Minister of Culture, he revived 18th-century weaving techniques so as to reproduce the silks used in the decoration of Versailles.
2763	The two greatest achievements of this initiative are seen today in wall hangings used in the restoration of the chambre de la reine in the grand appartement de reine and the chambre du roi in the appartement du roi.
2764	While the design used for the chambre du roi was, in fact, from the original design to decorate the chambre de la reine, it nevertheless represents a great achievement in the ongoing restoration at Versailles.
2765	Additionally, this project, which took over seven years to achieve, required several hundred kilograms of silver and gold to complete.
2766	One of the more costly endeavours for the museum and France's Fifth Republic has been to repurchase as much of the original furnishings as possible.
2767	Consequently, because furniture with a royal provenance – and especially furniture that was made for Versailles – is a highly sought after commodity on the international market, the museum has spent considerable funds on retrieving much of the palace's original furnishings.
2768	21st centuryIn 2003, a new restoration initiative – the \\"Grand Versailles\\" project – was started, which began with the replanting of the gardens, which had lost over 10,000 trees during Hurricane Lothar on 26 December 1999.
2769	One part of the initiative, the restoration of the Hall of Mirrors, was completed in 2006.
2770	Another major project was the further restoration of the backstage areas Royal Opera of Versailles, which was completed in 2009.
2771	Ownership and managementThe Palace of Versailles is owned by the French state.
2772	Its formal title is the Public Establishment of the Palace, Museum and National Estate of Versailles Since 1995, it has been run as a Public Establishment, with an independent administration and management supervised by the French Ministry of Culture.
2773	The current Chairperson of the Public Establishment is Catherine Pégard.
2774	Architecture and planThe Marble Court and facades of the first Chateau, embellished by Louis Le Vau (1661–68) and then Hardouin-Mansart in (1679–1681)Plan of the main floor (c. 1837, with north to the right), showing the Hall of Mirrors in red, the Hall of Battles in green, the Royal Chapel in yellow, and the Royal Opera in blueAerial view from the gardenThe facade facing the garden, with the royal apartments and the Gallery of Mirrors between themThe Palace of Versailles offers a visual history of French architecture from the 17th century to the end of the 18th century.
2775	It began with the original château, with the brick and stone and sloping slate mansard roofs of the Louis XIII style used by architect Philibert Le Roy.
2776	It then became grander and more monumental, with the addition of the colonnades and flat roofs of the new royal apartments in the French classical or Louis XIV style, as designed by Louis Le Vau and later Jules Hardouin-Mansart.
2777	It concluded in the lighter and more graceful neoclassical Louis XVI style of the Petit Trianon, completed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel in 1768.
2778	The palace was largely completed by the death of Louis XIV in 1715.
2779	The eastern facing palace has a U-shaped layout, with the corps de logis and symmetrical advancing secondary wings terminating with the Dufour Pavilion on the south and the Gabriel Pavilion to the north, creating an expansive cour d'honneur known as the Royal Court (Cour Royale).
2780	Flanking the Royal Court are two enormous asymmetrical wings that result in a facade of  in length.
2781	Encompassing  the palace has 700 rooms, more than 2,000 windows, 1,250 fireplaces and 67 staircases.
2782	The façade of Louis XIII's original château is preserved on the entrance front.
2783	Built of red brick and cut stone embellishments, the U-shaped layout surrounds a black-and-white marble courtyard.
2784	In the center, a 3-storey avant-corps fronted with eight red marble columns supporting a gilded wrought-iron balcony is surmounted with a triangle of lead statuary surrounding a large clock, whose hands were stopped upon the death of Louis XIV.
2785	The rest of the façade is completed with columns, painted and gilded wrought-iron balconies and dozens of stone tables decorated with consoles holding marble busts of Roman emperors.
2786	Atop the mansard slate roof are elaborate dormer windows and gilt lead roof dressings that were added by Hardouin-Mansart in 1679–1681.
2787	 Inspired by the architecture of baroque Italian villas, but executed in the French classical style, the garden front and wings were encased in white cut ashlar stone known as the enveloppe in 1668-1671 by Le Vau and modified by Hardouin-Mansart in 1678–1679.
2788	The exterior features an arcaded, rusticated ground floor, supporting a main floor with round-headed windows divided by reliefs and pilasters or columns.
2789	The attic storey has square windows and pilasters and crowned by a balustrade bearing sculptured trophies and flame pots dissimulating a flat roof.
2790	Royal ApartmentsPlan of the main floor in the central part of the palace (c. 1742), showing the grand appartement du roi in dark blue, the appartement du roi in medium blue, the petit appartement du roi in light blue, the grand appartement de la reine in yellow, and the petit appartement de la reine in red The construction in 1668–1671 of Le Vau's enveloppe around the outside of Louis XIII's red brick and white stone château added state apartments for the king and the queen.
2791	The addition was known at the time as the château neuf (new château).
2792	The grands appartements (Grand Apartments, also referred to as the State Apartments) include the grand appartement du roi and the grand appartement de la reine.
2793	They occupied the main or principal floor of the château neuf, with three rooms in each apartment facing the garden to the west and four facing the garden parterres to the north and south, respectively.
2794	The private apartments of the king (the appartement du roi and the petit appartement du roi) and those of the queen (the petit appartement de la reine) remained in the château vieux (old château).
2795	Le Vau's design for the state apartments closely followed Italian models of the day, including the placement of the apartments on the main floor (the piano nobile, the next floor up from the ground level), a convention the architect borrowed from Italian palace design.
2796	The king's State Apartment consisted of an enfilade of seven rooms, each dedicated to one of the known planets and their associated titular Roman deity.
2797	The queen's apartment formed a parallel enfilade with that of the grand appartement du roi.
2798	After the addition of the Hall of Mirrors (1678–1684) the king's apartment was reduced to five rooms (until the reign of Louis XV, when two more rooms were added) and the queen's to four.
2799	The queen's apartments served as the residence of three queens of France - Marie-Thérèse d'Autriche, wife of Louis XIV, Marie Leczinska, wife of Louis XV, and Marie-Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI.
2800	Additionally, Louis XIV's granddaughter-in-law, Princess Marie-Adélaïde of Savoy, duchesse de Bourgogne, wife of the Petit Dauphin, occupied these rooms from 1697 (the year of her marriage) to her death in 1712.
2801	The State Apartments of the KingthumbMeal at the House of Simon the Pharisee by Veronese in the Salon of HerculesThe Salon of AbundanceThe Salon of VenusThe Salon of MercuryThe construction of the Hall of Mirrors between 1678 and 1686 coincided with a major alteration to the State Apartments.
2802	They were originally intended as his residence, but the King transformed them into galleries for his finest paintings, and venues for his many receptions for courtiers.
2803	During the season from All-Saints Day in November until Easter, these were usually held three times a week, from six to ten in the evening, with various entertainments.
2804	The Salon of HerculesThis was originally a chapel.
2805	It was rebuilt beginning in 1712 as a showcase for the painting Meal at the House of Simon the Pharisee by Paolo Veronese, which was a gift to Louis XIV from the Republic of Venice in 1664.
2806	The painting on the ceiling, The Apotheosis of Hercules, by François Lemoyne, was completed in 1712, and gave the room its name.
2807	The Salon of AbundanceThe Salon of Abundance was the antechamber to the Cabinet of Curios (now the Games Room), which displayed Louis XIV's collection of precious jewels and rare objects.
2808	Some of the objects in the collection are depicted in René-Antoine Houasse's painting Abundance and Liberality (1683), located on the ceiling over the door opposite the windows.
2809	The Salon of VenusThis salon was used for serving light meals during evening receptions.
2810	The principal feature in this room is Jean Warin's life-size statue of Louis XIV in the costume of a Roman emperor.
2811	On the ceiling in a gilded oval frame is another painting by Houasse, Venus subjugating the Gods and Powers (1672-1681).
2812	Trompe l'oeil paintings and sculpture around the ceiling illustrate mythological themes.
2813	The Salon of Mercury
2814	The Salon of Mercury was the original State Bedchamber when Louis XIV officially moved the court and government to the Palace in 1682.
2815	The bed is a replica of the original commissioned by King Louis-Philippe in the 19th century when he turned the Palace into a Museum.
2816	The ceiling paintings by the Flemish artist Jean Baptiste de Champaigne depicts the god Mercury in his chariot, drawn by a rooster, and Alexander the Great and Ptolemy surrounded by scholars and philosophers.
2817	The Automaton Clock was made for the King by the royal clockmaker Antoine Morand in 1706.
2818	When it chimes the hour, figures of Louis XIV and Fame descend from a cloud.
2819	Salon of MarsCeiling in the Salon of Apollo, depicting the Sun Chariot of ApolloBust of Louis XIV by Bernini in Salon of DianaThe Salon of MarsThe Salon of Mars was used by the royal guards until 1782, and was decorated on a military theme with helmets and trophies.
2820	It was turned into a concert room between 1684 and 1750, with galleries for musicians on either side.
2821	Portraits of Louis XV and his Queen, Marie Leszczinska, by the Flemish artist Carle Van Loo decorate the room today.
2822	The Salon of ApolloThe Salon of Apollo was the royal throne room under Louis XIV, and was the setting for formal audiences.
2823	The eight-foot high silver throne was melted down in 1689 to help pay the costs of an expensive war, and was replaced by a more modest throne of gilded wood.
2824	The central painting on the ceiling, by Charles de la Fosse, depicts the Sun Chariot of Apollo, the King's favorite emblem, pulled by four horses and surrounded by the four seasons.
2825	The Salon of DianaThe Salon of Diana was used by Louis XIV as a billiards room, and had galleries from which courtiers could watch him play.
2826	The decoration of the walls and ceiling depicts scenes from the life of the goddess Diana.
2827	The celebrated bust of Louis XIV by Bernini made during the famous sculptor's visit to France in 1665, is on display here.
2828	Private apartments of the King and QueenThe King's bedchamberThe Queen's bedchamberThe gilded cabinet of Marie-AntoinetteBilliard Room of Marie-AntoinettePrivate apartments of the KingThe apartments of the King were the heart of the chateau; they were in the same location as the rooms of Louis XIII, the creator of the chateau, on the first floor (second floor US style).
2829	They were set aside for the personal use of Louis XIV in 1683.
2830	He and his successors Louis XV and Louis XVI used these rooms for official functions, such as the ceremonial lever (\\"waking up\\") and the coucher (\\"going to bed\\") of the monarch, which were attended by a crowd of courtiers.
2831	The King's apartment was accessed from the Hall of Mirrors from the Oeil de Boeuf antechamber past the Guardroom and the Grand Couvert, the ceremonial room where Louis XIV often took his evening meals, seated alone at a table in front of the fireplace.
2832	His spoon, fork, and knife were brought to him in a golden box.
2833	The courtiers could watch as he dined.
2834	The King's bedchamber had originally been the State Drawing Room and had been used by Queen Marie-Theresa, but after her death in 1701 Louis XIV took it over to use as his own bedroom and died there on September 1, 1715.
2835	Both Louis XV and Louis XVI continued to use the bedroom for their official awakening and going to bed.
2836	On October 6, 1789, from the balcony of this room Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, joined by the Marquis de Lafayette, looked down on the hostile crowd in the courtyard, shortly before the King was forced to return to Paris.
2837	The bed of the King is placed beneath a carved relief by Nicolas Coustou entitled  France watching over the sleeping King.
2838	The decoration includes several paintings set into the paneling, including a self-portrait of Antony Van Dyck.
2839	Private apartments of The QueenThe petit appartement de la reine is a suite of rooms that were reserved for the personal use of the queen.
2840	Originally arranged for the use of the Marie-Thérèse, consort of Louis XIV, the rooms were later modified for use by Marie Leszczyńska and finally for Marie-Antoinette.
2841	The Queen's apartments and the King's Apartments were laid out on the same design, each suite having seven rooms.
2842	Both suites had ceilings painted with scenes from mythology; the King's ceilings featured male figures, the Queen's featured females.
2843	The Grand GalleryThe Peace SalonThe Peace Salon; Louis XV sharing benefits of peace by François LemoyneThe Galerie des Glaces or Hall of MirrorsGuerdirons or candle holders in the Hall of MirrorsRelief of Louis XIV in the Salon of War, by Antoine Coysevox (1715)The Grand Gallery is a set of three highly decorated reception rooms, dedicated to the celebration of the political and military successes of Louis XIV, and used for important ceremonies, celebrations and receptions.
2844	The War SalonThe War Salon commemorates the victorious campaign of Louis XIV against the Dutch, which ended in 1678.
2845	The centerpiece is an enormous sculpted medallion of Louis XIV, on horseback, crossing the Rhine in 1672, created by Antoine Coysevox.
2846	Above the fireplace is a painting of Clio, the Muse of History, recording the exploits of the King.
2847	The Hall of MirrorsThe Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors), is perhaps the most famous room in the château of Versailles.
2848	It took the place of the rooftop terrace overlooking the gardens which formerly connected the apartments of the King and Queen.
2849	The construction of the room began in 1678 and finished in 1689.
2850	The gallery is more than  long, and it is lined with 17 wide arcaded mirrors, designed to match and reflect the windows opposite facing the gardens.
2851	Charles Le Brun painted thirty scenes of the early reign of Louis XIV on the ceiling.
2852	The centerpiece is a painting of the King titled, \\"The King Governing Alone\\".
2853	It shows Louis XIV, facing the powers of Europe, turning away from his pleasures to accept a crown of immortality from Glory, with the encouragement of Mars.
2854	The hall was originally furnished with solid silver furniture designed by Le Brun, but these furnishings were melted down in 1689 to help pay for war expenses.
2855	The King kept a silver throne, usually located in the Salon of Apollo, which was brought to the Hall of Mirrors for formal ceremonies, such as the welcome of foreign ambassadors, including a delegation from the King of Siam in 1686.
2856	It was also used for large events, such as full-dress and masked balls.
2857	Light was provided by candelabra on large gilded guerdirons lining the hall.
2858	Those on display today were made in 1770 for the marriage of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, based on the moldings of earlier silver versions made by LeBrun that had been melted down.
2859	The twenty-four crystal chandeliers were hung only for special occasions.
2860	Courtiers gathered in the Hall to watch the King walk from his apartments to the chapel, and sometimes took the occasion to present him with requests.
2861	The Peace SalonThe Peace Salon is decorated to illustrate the role of France as the arbiter and peacemaker of Europe under Louis XV.
2862	The painting on the ceiling by François Lemoyne, Louis XV offering an olive branch to Europe, illustrates this theme.
2863	During the reign of Louis XV, the Queen, Marie Leszczyńska, used this salon as a music room, organizing concerts of secular and religious music each Sunday.
2864	Royal ChapelRoyal Chapel seen from the ground floor The Royal Chapel, seen from the Royal GalleryThe Royal Chapel, the tallest building of the PalaceAltar and organ of the Royal ChapelGlory holding a portrait of Louis XV, by Antoine Vassé, in the chapel vestibuleThe Chapel was the last building at Versailles to be completed during the reign of Louis XIV.
2865	It was consecrated in 1710, and was dedicated to Louis IX of France, the ancestor and patron saint of the King.
2866	Construction was begun by Hardouin-Mansart in 1699, and was completed by de Corte.
2867	Daily services, wedding ceremonies, and baptisms were held in this chapel until 1789.
2868	Like other royal chapels, it had two levels: the King and family worshipped in the Royal Gallery on the upper level, while ordinary courtiers stood on the ground level.
2869	The paintings on the ceiling display scenes depicting the three figures of the trinity.
2870	In the center is The Glory of the Father Announcing the Coming of the Messiah by Antoine Coypel, above the altar is The Resurrection of Christ, and above the royal gallery is The Holy Spirit Descending Upon the Virgin and the Apostles.
2871	The corridor and vestibule that connected the Chapel and the State Apartments included later art, commissioned by Louis XV, intended to portray the link between Divinity and the King: a statue of Glory Holding the Medallion of Louis XV, by Antoine Vassé; and Royal Magnanimity by Jacques Bousseau.
2872	Royal OperaThe Royal BoxFoyer of the Royal OperaThe Royal Opera during the celebration of the marriage of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette (1770)Stage of the Royal OperaCeiling of the opera, painted by Louis Jean-Jacques Durameau
2873	The Royal Opera of Versailles was originally commissioned by Louis XIV in 1682 and was to be built at the end of the North Wing with a design by Mansart and Vigarani.
2874	However, due to the expense of the King's continental wars, the project was put aside.
2875	The idea was revived by Louis XV with a new design by Ange-Jacques Gabriel in 1748, but this also was temporarily put aside.
2876	The project was revived and rushed ahead for the planned celebration of the marriage of the Dauphin, the future Louis XVI, and Marie-Antoinette.
2877	For economy and speed, the new opera was built almost entirely of wood, which also gave it very high quality acoustics.
2878	The wood was painted to resemble marble, and the ceiling was decorated with a painting of the Apollo, the god of the arts, preparing crowns for illustrious artists, by Louis Jean-Jacques Durameau.
2879	The sculptor Augustin Pajou added statuary and reliefs to complete the decoration.
2880	The new Opera was inaugurated on May 16, 1770, as part of the celebration of the royal wedding.
2881	In October 1789, early in the French Revolution, the last banquet for the royal guardsmen was hosted by the King in the opera, before he departed for Paris.
2882	Following the Franco-German War in 1871 and then the Paris Commune until 1875, the French National Assembly met in the opera, until the proclamation of the Third French Republic and the return of the government to Paris.
2883	Museum of the History of FranceLouis Philippe dedicates the Gallery of Battles, by François Joseph Heim (1837)thumbright200pxThe Gallery of Battles in the Museum of the History of FranceThe Battle of Taillebourg, by Eugène Delacroix (1837)Louis Philippe and his sons pose before the gates of Versailles, by Horace Vernet History Gallery, (1846)
2884	Shortly after becoming King in 1830, Louis Philippe I decided to transform the Palace, which was empty of furnishings and in poor repair, into a museum devoted to \\"All the Glories of France,\\" with paintings and sculpture depicting famous French victories and heroes.
2885	The walls of the apartments of the courtiers and lesser members of the royal family on the first floor (second floor U.S. style) were demolished, and turned into a series of several large galleries: the Coronation Room, which displays the celebrated painting of the coronation of Napoleon I by Jacques-Louis David; the Hall of Battles; commemorating French victories with large-scale paintings; and the 1830 room, which celebrated Louis-Philippe's own coming tol power in the French Revolution of 1830.
2886	Some paintings were brought from the Louvre, including works depicting events in French history by Philippe de Champaigne, Pierre Mignard, Laurent de La Hyre, Charles Le Brun, Adam Frans van der Meulen, Nicolas de Largillière, Hyacinthe Rigaud, Jean-Antoine Houdon, Jean-Marc Nattier, Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun, Hubert Robert, Thomas Lawrence, Jacques-Louis David, and Antoine-Jean Gros.
2887	Others were commissioned especially for the museum by prominent artists of the early 19th century, including Eugène Delacroix, who painted Saint Louis at the French victory over the British in the Battle of Taillebourg in 1242.
2888	Other painters featured include Horace Vernet and François Gérard.
2889	A monumental painting by Vernet features Louis Philippe himself, with his sons, posing in front of the gates of the Palace.
2890	The overthrow of Louis Philippe in 1848 put an end to his grand plans for the museum, but the Gallery of Battles is still as it was, and is passed through by many visitors to the royal apartments and grand salons.
2891	Another set of rooms on the first floor has been made into galleries on Louis XIV and his court, displaying furniture, paintings, and sculpture.
2892	In recent years, eleven rooms on the ground floor between the Chapel and the Opera have been turned into a history of the palace, with audiovisual displays and models.
2893	Gardens and fountainsBassin de Flore (1672-1679)thumbThe Orangerie gardenFountain of Latona, with the Grand Canal in the backgroundAndré Le Nôtre began transforming the park and gardens of Versailles in the early 1660s.
2894	They are the finest example of the jardin à la française, or the French formal garden.
2895	They were originally designed to be viewed from the terrace on the west side of the palace, and to create a grand perspective that reached to the horizon, illustrating the king's complete dominance over nature.
2896	The Parterre d'Eau and the Parterre and Fountain of Latona
2897	The features closest to the Palace are the two water parterres, large pools which reflect the facade of the palace.
2898	These are decorated with smaller works of sculpture, representing the rivers of France, which are placed so as not to interfere with the reflections in the water.
2899	Down a stairway from the Parterre d'Eau is the Latona Fountain, created in 1670, illustrating the story of Latona taken from the Metamorphoses of Ovid.
2900	According to the story, when the peasants of Lycia insulted Latona, the mother of Apollo and Diana, the god Jupiter transformed the peasants into frogs.
2901	The fountain was begun in 1670 by Le Nôtre, then enlarged and modified by Hardouin-Mansart, who placed the statue of Latona atop a marble pyramid.
2902	Fountain of the Chariot of Apollo and the Grand CanalThe Grand Perspective of the palace continues from the Fountain of Latona south along a grassy lane, the Tapis Vert or green carpet, to the Basin of the Chariot of Apollo.
2903	Apollo, the sun god, was the emblem of Louis XIV, featured in much of the decoration of the palace.
2904	The chariot rising from the water symbolized the rising of the sun.
2905	It was designed by Le Brun and made by the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Tuby between 1668 and 1670, cast in iron and then gilded.
2906	Beyond the fountain, the Grand Canal extends 1800 meters to the south end of the park.
2907	North Parterre, Dragon Basin, and Basin of NeptuneAnother group of formal gardens is located on the north side of the water parterre.
2908	It includes two bosquets or groves: the grove of the Three Fountains, The Bosquet of the Arch of Triumph, and north of these, three major fountains, the Pyramid Fountain, Dragon Fountain, and the Neptune Fountain.
2909	The fountains in this area all have a maritime or aquatic theme; the Pyramid Fountain is decorated with Tritons, Sirens, dolphins and nymphs.
2910	The Dragon Fountain is one of the oldest at Versailles and has the highest jet of water, twenty-seven meters.
2911	It is not actually a dragon, but a python, a mythical serpent that was killed by Apollo.
2912	The Neptune Fountain was originally decorated only with a circle of large lead basins jetting water; Louis XV added statues of Neptune, Triton and other gods of the sea.
2913	South Parterre and the OrangerieThe South Parterre is located beneath the windows of the queen's apartments and on the roof of the Orangerie.
2914	It is decorated with box trees and flowers in arabesque patterns.
2915	The underground orangerie was designed to hold over a thousand citrus fruit, palms and oleanders, and other southern-climate trees during winter.
2916	They are taken out into the gardens from mid-May until mid-October.
2917	The Fountains and the Shortage of WaterSupplying water for the fountains of Versailles was a major problem for the royal government.
2918	The 18th-century waterworks at Marly— the Machine de Marly that fed the fountains— was possibly the biggest mechanical system of its time.
2919	The water came in from afar on monumental stone aqueducts which have long ago fallen into disrepair or been torn down.
2920	Some aqueducts, such as the unfinished Canal de l'Eure, which passes through the gardens of the Château de Maintenon, were never completed for want of resources or due to the exigencies of war.
2921	Despite enormous investment in canals and machinery for hoisting water, Versailles never had a sufficient water supply for its hundreds of fountains.
2922	When the King promenaded in the gardens, fountains were turned on only when the King was approaching them, and turned off after he departed.
2923	Today, only a few fountains are supplied with water, and only operate on a very limited schedule.
2924	The Bosquets or GrovesThe Three Fountains BosquetThe Ballroom Bosquet The Colonnade BosquetThe largest part of the garden is divided into geometric bosquets, compartment-like groves; eight on the north side of the garden, and six to the south.
2925	The bosquets were created for Louis XIV between 1680 and 1690.
2926	They were bordered with high trees and carefully trimmed in cubic forms to resemble rooms with walls of greenery.
2927	Each bosquet had its own theme and fountains, statuary, grottoes, and other decoration.
2928	Some were highly formal, like Hardouin-Mansart's Bosquet de la Colonnade, with a circle of columns alternating with fountains, while others imitated nature.
2929	They were often used for concerts or theatrical performances.
2930	Some of the early groves were altered beyond recognition by later monarchs, but the most famous bosquets, Le Nôtre's Salle de Bal (literally, \\"ballroom\\"), also known as the Bosquet des Rocailles (c. 1685), and Hardouin-Mansart's Bosquet de la Colonnade, have both been restored to the way they were under Louis XIV.
2931	Other notable groves include Les Dômes, the Bosquet d'Encelade (after Enceladus, c. 1675), the Théâtre d'Eau (Water Theater), and the Bains d'Apollon (Baths of Apollo).
2932	Some are now decorated with contemporary works of art.
2933	The Grand Trianon and Petit TrianonPeristyle of the Grand TrianonWest facade of the Petit TrianonThe Temple of LoveThe Queen's Theater at the Petit TrianonIn 1668 Louis XIV decided to build a smaller palace some distance from the main palace, where he could spend quieter time away from the crowds and formality of his Court.
2934	He purchased a village called Trianon which adjoined the park, and constructed a pavilion covered with blue and white porcelain in the fashionable Chinese style; it was finished in 1670, and became known as the Porcelain Trianon.
2935	In 1687, he replaced it with the Grand Trianon, a larger and more classical pavilion designed by Mansart, with a terrace and walls faced with different colored slabs of marble.
2936	After the Revolution, the Trianon served as a residence for both Napoleon I and later for King Louis-Philippe when they visited Versailles.
2937	It is decorated today largely as it was under Napoleon and Louis-Philippe.
2938	The Petit Trianon was created between 1763 and 1768 by Ange-Jacques Gabriel for Louis XV.
2939	The square shaped building, with each facade different, was a prototype of Neoclassicism in France.
2940	The most ornate facade, with Corinthian columns, faced the French landscape garden.
2941	Louis XVI gave the Petit Trianon as a gift to his bride, Marie-Antoinette.
2942	She asked the architect Richard Mique and painter Hubert Robert to design a new English-style landscape garden to replace the formal French garden.
2943	Not far from the Petit Trianon she had the Rock Pavilion constructed, and added the classical rotunda of the Temple of Love, built in 1777.
2944	In 1780, she built a small theater at the Petit Trianon.
2945	In her theater she played a part in one of the first performances of the play The Marriage of Figaro by Pierre Beaumarchais, which helped ensure its success.
2946	She was at the Petit Trianon in July 1789 when she first heard the news from Paris of the storming of the Bastille and the beginning of the French Revolution.
2947	The Hamlet of Marie AntoinetteThe Hamlet of the Queen One of the most celebrated features of the park is the Hameau de la Reine, a small rustic hamlet near the Petit Trianon created for Queen Marie Antoinette between 1783 and 1785 by the royal architect Richard Mique with the help of the painter Hubert Robert.
2948	It replaced a botanical garden created by Louis XV, and consisted of twelve structures, ten of which still exist, in the style of villages in Normandy.
2949	It was designed for the Queen and her friends to amuse themselves by playing peasants, and included a farmhouse with a dairy, a mill, a boudoir, a pigeon loft, a tower in the form of a lighthouse from which one could fish in the pond, a belvedere, a cascade and grotto, and a luxuriously furnished cottage with a billiard room for the Queen.
2950	Modern Political and ceremonial functionsThe palace still serves political functions.
2951	Heads of state are regaled in the Hall of Mirrors; the bicameral French Parliament&mdash;consisting of the Senate (Sénat) and the National Assembly (Assemblée nationale)&mdash;meet in joint session (a congress of the French Parliament) in Versailles to revise or otherwise amend the French Constitution, a tradition that came into effect with the promulgation of the 1875 Constitution.
2952	For example, the Parliament met in joint session at Versailles to pass constitutional amendments in June 1999 (for domestic applicability of International Criminal Court decisions and for gender equality in candidate lists), in January 2000 (ratifying the Treaty of Amsterdam), and in March 2003 (specifying the \\"decentralized organization\\" of the French Republic).
2953	In 2009, President Nicolas Sarkozy addressed the global financial crisis before a congress in Versailles, the first time that this had been done since 1848, when Charles-Louis Napoleon Bonaparte gave an address before the French Second Republic.
2954	Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, President François Hollande gave a speech before a rare joint session of parliament at the Palace of Versailles.
2955	This was the third time since 1848 that a French president addressed a joint session of the French Parliament at Versailles.
2956	The president of the National Assembly has an official apartment at the Palace of Versailles.
2957	CostOne of the most baffling aspects to the study of Versailles is the cost – how much Louis XIV and his successors spent on Versailles.
2958	Owing to the nature of the construction of Versailles and the evolution of the role of the palace, construction costs were essentially a private matter.
2959	Initially, Versailles was planned to be an occasional residence for Louis XIV and was referred to as the \\"king's house\\".
2960	Accordingly, much of the early funding for construction came from the king's own purse, funded by revenues received from his appanage as well as revenues from the province of New France (Canada), which, while part of France, was a private possession of the king and therefore exempt from the control of the Parliaments.
2961	Once Louis XIV embarked on his building campaigns, expenses for Versailles became more of a matter for public record, especially after Jean-Baptiste Colbert assumed the post of finance minister.
2962	Expenditures on Versailles have been recorded in the compendium known as the Comptes des bâtiments du roi sous le règne de Louis XIV and which were edited and published in five volumes by Jules Guiffrey in the 19th century.
2963	These volumes provide valuable archival material pursuant to the financial expenditure on all aspects of Versailles such as the payments disbursed for many trades as varied as artists and mole catchers.
2964	To counter the costs of Versailles during the early years of Louis XIV's personal reign, Colbert decided that Versailles should be the \\"showcase\\" of France.
2965	Accordingly, all materials that went into the construction and decoration of Versailles were manufactured in France.
2966	Even the mirrors used in the decoration of the Hall of Mirrors were made in France.
2967	While Venice in the 17th century had the monopoly on the manufacture of mirrors, Colbert succeeded in enticing a number of artisans from Venice to make the mirrors for Versailles.
2968	However, owing to Venetian proprietary claims on the technology of mirror manufacture, the Venetian government ordered the assassination of the artisans to keep the secrets proprietary to the Venetian Republic.
2969	To meet the demands for decorating and furnishing Versailles, Colbert nationalised the tapestry factory owned by the Gobelin family, to become the Manufacture royale des Gobelins.
2970	Louis XIV visits the Gobelins with Colbert, 15 October 1667.
2971	Tapestry from the series, \\"Histoire du roi\\" designed by Charles Le Brun and woven between 1667 and 1672.
2972	Articles of Louis XIV's silver furniture are seen in this tapestry.
2973	In 1667, the name of the enterprise was changed to the Manufacture royale des Meubles de la Couronne.
2974	The Gobelins were charged with all decoration needs of the palace, which was under the direction of Charles Le Brun.
2975	One of the most costly elements in the furnishing of the grands appartements during the early years of the personal reign of Louis XIV was the silver furniture, which can be taken as a standard – with other criteria – for determining a plausible cost for Versailles.
2976	The Comptes meticulously list the expenditures on the silver furniture – disbursements to artists, final payments, delivery – as well as descriptions and weight of items purchased.
2977	Entries for 1681 and 1682 concerning the silver balustrade used in the salon de Mercure serve as an example:Year 1681II.

2992	Accordingly, the silver balustrade, which contained in excess of one ton of silver, cost in excess of 560,000 livres.
2993	It is difficult – if not impossible – to give an accurate rate of exchange between 1682 and today.
2994	However, Frances Buckland provides valuable information that provides an idea of the true cost of the expenditures at Versailles during the time of Louis XIV.
2995	In 1679, Mme de Maintenon stated that the cost of providing light and food for twelve people for one day amounted to slightly more than 14 livres.
2996	In December 1689, to defray the cost of the War of the League of Augsburg, Louis XIV ordered all the silver furniture and articles of silver at Versailles – including chamber pots – sent to the mint to be melted.
2997	Clearly, the silver furniture alone represented a significant outlay in the finances of Versailles.
2998	While the decoration of the palace was costly, certain other costs were minimised.
2999	For example, labour for construction was often low, due largely to the fact that the army during times of peace and during the winter, when wars were not waged, was pressed into action at Versailles.
3000	Additionally, given the quality and uniqueness of the items produced at the Gobelins for use and display at Versailles, the palace served as a venue to showcase not only the success of Colbert's mercantilism, but also to display the finest that France could produce.
3001	Estimates of the amount spent to build Versailles are speculative.
3002	An estimate in 2000 placed the amount spent during the Ancien Régime as US$2 billion, this figure being, in all probability, an under-evaluation.
3003	France's Fifth Republic expenditures alone, directed to restoration and maintenance at Versailles, may have surpassed those of the Sun King.

3026	The band's discography has grown to thirty-eight albums, including sixteen studio albums, twelve live albums, four EPs, and seven compilations.
3027	Pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s.
3028	After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US platinum and gold albums, including 1982's The Number of the Beast, 1983's Piece of Mind, 1984's Powerslave, 1985's live release Live After Death, 1986's Somewhere in Time and 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.
3029	Since the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the band have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with their 2010 studio offering, The Final Frontier, peaking at No. 1 in 28 countries and receiving widespread critical acclaim.
3030	Their sixteenth studio album, The Book of Souls, was released on 4 September 2015 to similar success.
3031	Despite little radio or television support, Iron Maiden are considered one of the most successful heavy metal bands in history, with The Sunday Times reporting in 2017 that the band have sold over 100 million copies of their albums worldwide.
3032	The band won the Ivor Novello Award for international achievement in 2002.
3033	, the band have played over 2000 live shows throughout their career.
3034	For over 35 years the band have been supported by their famous mascot, \\"Eddie\\", who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers, as well as in their live shows.
3035	HistoryEarly years (1975–1978)The Cart and Horses Pub, located in Maryland Point, Stratford, was where Iron Maiden played some of their first shows in 1976.
3036	Iron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 25 December 1975 by bassist Steve Harris shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler.
3037	Harris attributed the band's name to a film adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, the title of which reminded him of the iron maiden torture device.
3038	After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976, before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in Maryland Point, Stratford.
3039	The original line-up was short-lived, with vocalist Paul Day being the first casualty as, according to Harris, he lacked \\"energy or charisma on stage\\".
3040	He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a Kiss fan who used make-up and fake blood during live performances.
3041	Wilcock's friend, Dave Murray, was invited to join, much to the dismay of the band's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance.
3042	Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976, though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist.
3043	Harris and Murray remain the band's longest-standing members and have performed on all of their releases.
3044	Dave Murray and Steve Harris in 2008.
3045	Harris and Murray are the only members to have performed on all of the band's albums.
3046	Iron Maiden recruited yet another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth.
3047	Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray, as well as original drummer Ron Matthews.
3048	A new line-up was put together, including future Cutting Crew member Tony Moore on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer Barry Purkis (better known today as Thunderstick).
3049	A poor performance at the Bridgehouse, a pub located in Canning Town, in November 1977 was the line-up's first and only concert.
3050	Afterwards, Iron Maiden fired Purkis and replaced him with Doug Sampson.
3051	At the same time, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band's sound.
3052	A few months later, Dennis Wilcock decided to leave Iron Maiden to form his own band, V1, and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated.
3053	As he preferred to be the band's sole guitarist, Wapram disapproved of Murray's return, and was also dismissed.
3054	Harris, Murray, and Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band's new line-up.
3055	A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno.
3056	Steve Harris stated, \\"There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge.\\"
3057	At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, \\"Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own.
3058	The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult.
3059	\\"Record contract and early releases (1978–1981)On New Year's Eve 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a demo, consisting of four songs, at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge.
3060	Hoping that the recording would help them secure more gigs, the band presented a copy to Neal Kay, then managing a heavy metal club called \\"Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse\\", located in Kingsbury Circle, northwest London.
3061	Upon hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, \\"Prowler\\", eventually went to No. 1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in Sounds magazine.
3062	A copy was also acquired by Rod Smallwood, who soon became the band's manager, and, as Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as The Soundhouse Tapes, named after the club.
3063	Featuring only three tracks (one song, \\"Strange World\\", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production) all five thousand copies were sold out within weeks.
3064	In December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with EMI, and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend, Adrian Smith of Urchin, to join the group as their second guitarist.
3065	Due to his commitment to Urchin, Smith declined and Dennis Stratton was hired instead.
3066	Shortly afterwards, Doug Sampson left due to health issues, and was replaced by ex-Samson drummer Clive Burr at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December 1979.
3067	Iron Maiden's first appearance on an album was on the Metal for Muthas compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of \\"Sanctuary\\" and \\"Wrathchild\\".
3068	The release led to an ensuing tour which featured several other bands linked with the new wave of British heavy metal.
3069	Paul Di'Anno and Steve Harris supporting Judas Priest on their British Steel Tour, 1980 Iron Maiden released their eponymous self-titled album in 1980, which debuted at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart.
3070	In addition to the title track (a live version of which would be one of the first music videos aired on MTV), the album includes other early favourites such as \\"Running Free\\", \\"Transylvania\\", \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", and \\"Sanctuary\\" – which was not on the original UK release, but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters.
3071	The band embarked on a headline tour of the UK, before opening for Kiss on their 1980 Unmasked Tour's European leg as well as supporting Judas Priest on select dates.
3072	Iron Maiden also appeared, to much acclaim, at the Reading Festival 1980.
3073	They were second to top of the bill on the Saturday, with UFO headlining.
3074	After the Kiss tour, Dennis Stratton was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences, and was replaced by Adrian Smith in October 1980.
3075	In 1981, Iron Maiden released their second studio album, Killers.
3076	Containing many tracks written prior to their debut release, only two new songs were written for the record: \\"Prodigal Son\\" and \\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" (the latter's title was taken from the short story by Edgar Allan Poe).
3077	Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album, the band hired veteran producer Martin Birch, who would go on to work for Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992.
3078	The record was followed by the band's first world tour, which included their debut performance in the United States, opening for Judas Priest at The Aladdin Casino in Las Vegas.
3079	Success (1981–1985)By 1981, Paul Di'Anno was demonstrating increasingly self-destructive behaviour, particularly due to his drug usage, about which Di'Anno comments, \\"it wasn't just that I was snorting a bit of coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day ...
3080	the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see my way to the end of it.
3081	I knew I'd never last the whole tour.
3082	It was too much.\\"
3083	With his performances waning, Di'Anno was immediately dismissed following the Killer World Tour, at which point the band had already selected his replacement.
3084	After a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the Reading Festival, Bruce Dickinson, previously of Samson, auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired.
3085	 The following month, Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy, as well as a one-off show at the Rainbow Theatre in the UK.
3086	For the last show, and in anticipation of their forthcoming album, the band played \\"Children of the Damned\\" and \\"22 Acacia Avenue\\", introducing fans to the sound towards which they were progressing.
3087	In 1982, Iron Maiden released their third studio album, The Number of the Beast, which gave the band their first UK Albums Chart No. 1 record and additionally became a Top Ten hit in many other countries.
3088	At the time, Dickinson was in the midst of legal difficulties with Samson's management, and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits, although he still made what he described as a \\"moral contribution\\" to \\"Children of the Damned\\", \\"The Prisoner\\" and \\"Run to the Hills\\".
3089	For the second time the band embarked on a world tour, dubbed The Beast on the Road, during which they visited North America, Japan, Australia, and Europe, including a headline appearance at the Reading Festival.
3090	A new and hugely successful chapter in Iron Maiden's future was cemented; in 2010 The New York Times reported that the album had sold over 14 million copies worldwide.
3091	The Beast on the Road's US leg proved controversial when an American conservative political lobbying group claimed that Iron Maiden were Satanic because of the new album's title track, to the point where a group of Christian activists destroyed Iron Maiden records as a protest against the band.
3092	In recent years, Dickinson stated that the band treated this as \\"silliness\\", and that the demonstrations in fact gave them \\"loads of publicity\\".
3093	Nicko McBrain has been Iron Maiden's drummer since 1982 In December 1982, drummer Clive Burr was fired from the band and replaced by Nicko McBrain, who previously played for Trust.
3094	Although Harris stated that his dismissal took place because his live performances were affected by offstage activities, Burr objected to this, and claimed that he was unfairly ousted from the band.
3095	Soon afterwards, the band journeyed for the first time to The Bahamas to record the first of three consecutive albums at Compass Point Studios.
3096	In 1983, they released their fourth studio album, Piece of Mind, which reached the No. 3 spot in the UK, and was the band's debut in the North American charts, reaching No. 70 on the Billboard 200.
3097	Piece of Mind includes the successful singles, \\"The Trooper\\" and \\"Flight of Icarus\\", the latter of which being particularly notable as one of the band's few songs to gain substantial airplay in the US.
3098	Soon after the success of Piece of Mind and its supporting tour, the band released their fifth studio album, Powerslave, on 9 September 1984.
3099	The album features the singles \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\", \\"Aces High\\", as well as \\"Rime of The Ancient Mariner\\", based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem of the same name, and running over 13 minutes in length.
3100	The tour, following the album, dubbed the World Slavery Tour, was the band's largest to date, and consisted of 193 shows in 28 countries over 13 months, playing to an estimated 3,500,000 people.
3101	Many shows were played back-to-back in the same city, such as in Long Beach, California, where the band played four consecutive concerts.
3102	Their first live album, Live After Death, was recorded, which became a critical and commercial success, peaking at No. 4 in the UK.
3103	Iron Maiden also made their debut appearance in South America, where they co-headlined (with Queen) the Rock in Rio festival to an estimated 300,000 in attendance.
3104	The tour was physically gruelling for the band, who demanded six months off when it ended (although this was later reduced to four months).
3105	This was the first substantial break in the group's history, including the cancellation of a proposed supporting tour for the new live album, with Bruce Dickinson threatening to quit unless the tour ended.
3106	Experimentation (1986–1989)Returning from their time off, the band adopted a different style for their 1986 studio album, entitled Somewhere in Time, featuring, for the first time in the band's history, synthesised bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound.
3107	The release charted well across the world, particularly with the single \\"Wasted Years\\", but notably included no writing credits from Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band.
3108	While Dickinson was focused on his own music, guitarist Adrian Smith, who typically collaborated with the vocalist, was \\"left to [his] own devices\\" and began writing songs on his own, coming up with \\"Wasted Years\\", \\"Sea of Madness\\", and \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", the last of which would be the album's second single.
3109	The experimentation evident on Somewhere in Time continued on their next album, entitled Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which was released in 1988.
3110	A concept album, based on the 1987 novel Seventh Son by Orson Scott Card, would be the band's first record to include keyboards, performed by Harris and Smith, as opposed to guitar synthesisers on the previous release.
3111	After his contributions were not used for Somewhere in Time, Dickinson's enthusiasm was renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album.
3112	Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's second album to hit No. 1 in the UK charts, although it only achieved a Gold certification in the US, in contrast to its four predecessors.
3113	During the following tour, the band headlined the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park for the first time on 20 August 1988, playing to the largest crowd in the festival's history, with an estimated 107,000 in attendance.
3114	Also included on the bill were Kiss, David Lee Roth, Megadeth, Guns N' Roses, and Helloween.
3115	The festival was marred, however, by the deaths of two fans in a crowd-surge during the aforementioned Guns N' Roses performance; the following year's festival was cancelled as a result.
3116	The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the NEC Arena, Birmingham recorded for a live video, entitled Maiden England.
3117	Throughout the tour, Harris' bass technician, Michael Kenney, provided live keyboards.
3118	Kenney has acted as the band's live keyboard player ever since, also performing on the band's four following albums before Harris took over as the group's sole studio keyboardist from 2000's Brave New World.
3119	Upheaval (1989–1994)During another break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band ASAP, entitled Silver and Gold, and vocalist Bruce Dickinson began work on a solo album with former Gillan guitarist Janick Gers, releasing Tattooed Millionaire in 1990, followed by a tour.
3120	At the same time, to mark the band's ten-year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released a compilation collection, The First Ten Years, a series of ten CDs and double 12-inch singles.
3121	Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one-by-one, each containing two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the original B-sides.
3122	Soon afterwards, Iron Maiden regrouped to work on a new studio record.
3123	During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris, regarding the direction the band should be taking, disagreeing with the \\"stripped down\\" style that they were leaning towards.
3124	Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson's solo project, was chosen to replace Smith, and became the band's first new member in seven years.
3125	The album, No Prayer for the Dying, was released in October 1990, and contained \\"Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter\\", the band's first (and to date, only) UK Singles Chart No. 1, originally recorded by Dickinson's solo outfit for the soundtrack to A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child.
3126	The song was banned by the BBC and only a 90 sec live clip on Top of the Pops was shown.
3127	After another tour and some more time off, the band recorded their next studio album, Fear of the Dark, which was released in 1992 and included the stand-out title track, which is now a regular fixture in the band's concert setlists.
3128	Achieving their third No. 1 in the UK albums chart, the disc also featured the No. 2 single \\"Be Quick or Be Dead\\" and the No. 21 single \\"From Here to Eternity\\".
3129	The album featured the first songwriting by Gers, and no collaboration at all between Harris and Dickinson on songs.
3130	The extensive worldwide tour that followed included their first ever Latin American leg (after a single concert during the World Slavery Tour), and headlining the Monsters of Rock festivals in seven European countries.
3131	Iron Maiden's second performance at Donington Park, to an audience of 68,500 (the attendance was capped after the incident in 1988), was filmed for the audio and video release, Live at Donington, and featured a guest appearance by Adrian Smith, who joined the band to perform \\"Running Free\\".
3132	In 1993, Dickinson left the band to further pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a farewell tour and two live albums (later re-released in one package).
3133	The first, A Real Live One, featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and was released in March 1993.
3134	The second, A Real Dead One, featured songs from 1980 to 1984, and was released after Dickinson had left the band.
3135	The tour did not go well, with Steve Harris claiming that Dickinson would only perform properly for high-profile shows, and that at several concerts, he would only mumble into the microphone.
3136	Dickinson denied that he was under-performing, stating that it was impossible to \\"make like Mr Happy Face if the vibe wasn't right\\", saying that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour.
3137	He played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993, which was filmed, broadcast by the BBC, and released on video under the name Raising Hell.
3138	Blaze Bayley era, The X Factor and Virtual XI (1994–1999)In 1994, the band listened to hundreds of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing Blaze Bayley, formerly of the band Wolfsbane, who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them.
3139	Harris' preferred choice from the outset, Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor, which ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.
3140	After a two-year hiatus (as well as a three-year hiatus from studio releases – a record for the band at the time), Iron Maiden returned in 1995.
3141	Releasing their next studio album, The X Factor, the band had their lowest chart position since 1981 for an album in the UK (debuting at No. 8), although it would go on to win Album of the Year awards in France and Germany.
3142	 The record included the 11-minute epic \\"Sign of the Cross\\", the band's longest song since \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\", as well as the singles, \\"Man on the Edge\\", based on the film Falling Down, and \\"Lord of the Flies\\", based on the novel of the same name.
3143	The release is notable for its \\"dark\\" tone, inspired by Steve Harris' divorce.
3144	The band toured for the rest of 1995 and 1996, playing for the first time in Israel and South Africa, and ending in the Americas.
3145	After the tour, Iron Maiden released a compilation album, Best of the Beast.
3146	The band's first compilation
3147	, it included a new single, \\"Virus\\", in which the lyrics attack the critics, who had recently written off the band.
3148	In 1998, Iron Maiden released Virtual XI, whose chart scores were the band's lowest to date, failing to score one million worldwide sales for the first time in the band's history.
3149	The album peaked at No. 16in the UK; the band's lowest for a new studio record.
3150	 At the same time, Steve Harris assisted in remastering the band's entire discography, up to and including Live at Donington (which was given a mainstream release for the first time).
3151	Bayley's tenure in Iron Maiden ended in January 1999 when he was asked to leave during a band meeting.
3152	The dismissal took place due to issues Bayley had experienced with his voice during the Virtual XI World Tour, although Janick Gers stated that this was partly the band's fault for forcing him to perform songs, which were beyond his natural register.
3153	Return of Dickinson and Smith, Brave New World (1999–2002)Adrian Smith (left) re-joined Iron Maiden in 1999, resulting in a three guitar line-up.
3154	While the group were considering a replacement for Bayley, Rod Smallwood convinced Steve Harris to invite Bruce Dickinson back into the band.
3155	Although Harris admitted that he \\"wasn't really into it\\" at first, he then thought, \\"'Well, if the change happens, who should we get?'
3156	The thing is, we know Bruce and we know what he's capable of, and you think, 'Well, better the devil you know.'
3157	I mean, we got on well professionally for, like, eleven years, and so ... after I thought about it, I didn't really have a problem with it.
3158	\\"The band entered into talks with Dickinson, who agreed to rejoin during a meeting in Brighton in January 1999, along with guitarist Adrian Smith, who was telephoned a few hours later.
3159	With Gers, Smith's replacement, remaining, Iron Maiden now had a three-guitar line-up, and embarked on a hugely successful reunion tour.
3160	Dubbed The Ed Hunter Tour, it tied in with the band's newly released greatest hits collection, Ed Hunter, whose track listing was decided by a poll on the group's website, and also contained a computer game of the same name starring the band's mascot.
3161	One of Dickinson's primary concerns on rejoining the group \\"was whether we would in fact be making a real state-of-the-art record and not just a comeback album,\\" which eventually took the form of 2000's Brave New World.
3162	Having disliked the results from Harris' personal studio, Barnyard Studios located on his property in Essex, which had been used for the last four Iron Maiden studio albums, the band recorded the new release at Guillaume Tell Studios in Paris, France in November 1999 with producer Kevin Shirley.
3163	Thematic influences continued with \\"The Wicker Man\\" – based on the 1973 British cult film of the same name – and \\"Brave New World\\" – title taken from the Aldous Huxley novel of the same name.
3164	The album furthered the more progressive and melodic sound present in some earlier recordings, with elaborate song structures and keyboard orchestration.
3165	The world tour that followed consisted of well over 100 dates and culminated on 19 January 2001 in a show at the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil, where Iron Maiden played to an audience of around 250,000.
3166	While the performance was being produced for a CD and DVD release in March 2002, under the name Rock in Rio, the band took a year off from touring, during which they played three consecutive shows at Brixton Academy in aid of former drummer Clive Burr, who had recently announced that he had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.
3167	The band performed two further concerts for Burr's MS Trust Fund charity in 2005, and 2007, before his death in 2013.
3168	Dance of Death and A Matter of Life and Death (2003–2007)Following their Give Me Ed... 'Til I'm Dead Tour in the summer of 2003, Iron Maiden released Dance of Death, their thirteenth studio album, which was met by worldwide critical and commercial success.
3169	Produced by Kevin Shirley, now the band's regular producer, many critics also felt that this release matched up to their earlier efforts, such as Killers, Piece of Mind and The Number of the Beast.
3170	As usual, historical, and literary references were present, with \\"Montségur\\" in particular being about the Cathar stronghold conquered in 1244, and \\"Paschendale\\" relating to the significant battle which took place during The First World War.
3171	During the following tour, the band's performance at Westfalenhalle, in Dortmund, Germany, was recorded and released in August 2005 as a live album and DVD, entitled Death on the Road.
3172	In 2005, the band announced the Eddie Rips Up the World Tour, which, tying in with their 2004 DVD entitled The History of Iron Maiden – Part 1: The Early Days, only featured material from their first four albums.
3173	As part of this celebration of their earlier years, \\"The Number of the Beast\\" single was re-released and went straight to No. 3 in the UK Chart.
3174	The tour included many headlining stadium and festival dates, including a performance at Ullevi Stadium in Sweden to an audience of almost 60,000.
3175	This concert was also broadcast live on satellite television all over Europe to approximately 60 million viewers.
3176	Following this run of European shows, the band co-headlined the US festival tour, Ozzfest, with Black Sabbath, their final performance at which earned international press coverage after their show was sabotaged by singer Ozzy Osbourne's family, who took offence to Dickinson's remarks against reality-TV.
3177	The band completed the tour by headlining the Reading and Leeds Festivals on the 26–28 August, and the RDS Stadium in Ireland on 31 August.
3178	For the second time, the band played a charity show for The Clive Burr MS Trust Fund, which took place at the Hammersmith Apollo.
3179	The same year, the band were inducted into the Hollywood RockWalk in Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles.

3181	Throughout the tour's first leg, the band played the A Matter of Life and Death album in its entirety.
3182	At the end of 2005, Iron Maiden began work on A Matter of Life and Death, their fourteenth studio album, released in autumn 2006.
3183	While not a concept album, war and religion are recurring themes in the lyrics, as well as in the cover artwork.
3184	The release was a critical and commercial success, earning the band their first top ten in the Billboard 200 and receiving the Album of the Year award at the 2006 Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards.
3185	A supporting tour followed, during which they played the album in its entirety; response to this was mixed.
3186	The second part of the \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\" tour, which took place in 2007, was dubbed \\"A Matter of the Beast\\" to celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Number of the Beast album, and included appearances at several major festivals worldwide.
3187	The tour opened in the Middle East with the band's first performance in Dubai at the Dubai Desert Rock Festival, after which they played to over 30,000 people at the Bangalore Palace Grounds, marking the first concert by any major heavy metal band in the Indian sub-continent.
3188	The band went on to play a string of European dates, including an appearance at Download Festival, their fourth headline performance at Donington Park, to approximately 80,000 people.
3189	On 24 June they ended the tour with a performance at London's Brixton Academy in aid of The Clive Burr MS Trust fund.
3190	Somewhere Back in Time World Tour and Flight 666 (2007–2009)On 5 September 2007, the band announced their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour, which tied in with the DVD release of their Live After Death album.
3191	The setlist for the tour consisted of successes from the 1980s, with a specific emphasis on the Powerslave era for set design.
3192	The first part of the tour, commencing in Mumbai, India on 1 February 2008, consisted of 24 concerts in 21 cities, travelling nearly 50,000 miles in the band's own chartered aeroplane, named \\"Ed Force One\\".
3193	They played their first ever concerts in Costa Rica and Colombia and their first shows in Australia and Puerto Rico since 1992.
3194	Iron Maiden performing in Toronto during the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour 2008.
3195	The stage set largely emulated that of the World Slavery Tour 1984–85.
3196	The tour led to the release of a new compilation album, entitled Somewhere Back in Time, which included a selection of tracks from their 1980 eponymous debut to 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, as well as several live versions from Live After Death.
3197	The Somewhere Back in Time World Tour continued with two further legs in the US and Europe in the summer of 2008, during which the band used a more expansive stage-set, including further elements of the original Live After Death show.
3198	With the sole UK concert taking place at Twickenham Stadium, this would be the first time the band would headline a stadium in their own country.
3199	The three 2008 legs of the tour were remarkably successful; it was the second highest-grossing tour of the year for a British artist.
3200	The last part of the tour took place in February and March 2009, with the band, once again, using \\"Ed Force One\\".
3201	The final leg included the band's first ever appearances in Peru and Ecuador, as well as their return to Venezuela and New Zealand after 17 years.
3202	The band also played another show in India (their third in the country within a span of 2 years) at the Rock in India festival to a crowd of 20,000.
3203	At their concert in São Paulo on 15 March, Dickinson announced on stage that it was the largest non-festival show of their career, with an overall attendance of 63,000 people.
3204	The final leg ended in Florida on 2 April after which the band took a break.
3205	Overall, the tour reportedly had an attendance of over two million people worldwide over both years.
3206	At the 2009 BRIT Awards, Iron Maiden won the award for best British live act.
3207	Voted for by the public, the band reportedly won by a landslide.
3208	On 20 January 2009, the band announced that they were to release a full-length documentary film in select cinemas on 21 April 2009.
3209	Entitled Iron Maiden: Flight 666, it was filmed during the first part of the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour between February and March 2008.
3210	Flight 666 was co-produced by Banger Productions and was distributed in cinemas by Arts Alliance Media and EMI, with D&E Entertainment sub-distributing in the US.
3211	The film went on to have a Blu-ray, DVD, and CD release in May and June, topping the music DVD charts in 22 countries.
3212	The Final Frontier and Maiden England World Tour (2010–2014)
3213	Following announcements that the band had begun composition of new material and booked studio time in early 2010 with Kevin Shirley producing, The Final Frontier was announced on 4 March.
3214	The album, the band's fifteenth, was released on 16 August, garnering critical acclaim and the band's greatest commercial success in their history, reaching No. 1 in twenty-eight countries worldwide.
3215	Although Steve Harris had been quoted in the past as claiming that the band would only produce fifteen studio releases, band members have since confirmed that there will be at least one further record.
3216	The album's supporting tour saw the band perform 98 shows across the globe to an estimated audience of over 2 million, including their first visits to Singapore, Indonesia, and South Korea, before concluding in London on 6 August 2011.
3217	As the tour's 2010 leg preceded The Final Frontier's release, the band made \\"El Dorado\\" available as a free download on 8 June, which would go on to win the award for Best Metal Performance at the 2011 Grammy Awards on 13 February 2011.
3218	It was the band's first win following two previous Grammy nominations (\\"Fear of the Dark\\" in 1994 and \\"The Wicker Man\\" in 2001).
3219	On 15 March, a new compilation to accompany 2009's Somewhere Back in Time was announced.
3220	Entitled From Fear to Eternity, the original release date was set at 23 May, but was later delayed to 6 June.
3221	The double disc set covers the period 1990–2010 (the band's most recent eight studio albums), and, as on Somewhere Back in Time, live versions with Bruce Dickinson were included in place of original recordings which featured other vocalists, in this case Blaze Bayley.
3222	In a press release regarding From Fear to Eternity, band manager Rod Smallwood revealed that Iron Maiden would release a new concert video to DVD in 2011, filmed in Santiago, Chile and Buenos Aires, Argentina during The Final Frontier World Tour.
3223	On 17 January 2012, the band announced that the new release, entitled En Vivo!, based on footage from the Chile concert, would be made available worldwide on CD, LP, DVD, and Blu-ray on 26 March, except for the United States and Canada (where it was released on 27 March).
3224	In addition to the concert footage, the video release includes an 88-minute tour documentary, entitled Behind The Beast, containing interviews with the band and their crew.
3225	In December 2012, one song from the release (\\"Blood Brothers\\") was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards.
3226	On 15 February 2012, the band announced the Maiden England World Tour 2012–14, which was based around the video of the same name.
3227	The tour commenced in North America in the summer of 2012 and was followed by further dates in 2013 and 2014, which included the band's record-breaking fifth headline performance at Donington Park, their first show at the newly built national stadium in Stockholm, a return to the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil, and their debut appearance in Paraguay.
3228	In August 2012, Steve Harris stated that the Maiden England video would be re-issued in 2013, with a release date later set for 25 March 2013 in DVD, CD, and LP formats under the title Maiden England '88.
3229	The Book of Souls and Legacy of the Beast (2015–present)Following confirmation from the group that 2010's The Final Frontier would not be their last album, Bruce Dickinson revealed plans for a sixteenth studio record in July 2013, with a potential release date in 2015.
3230	In February 2015, drummer Nicko McBrain revealed that a new album had been completed, although the release was put on hold as Dickinson was recovering from treatment for a cancerous tumour found on his tongue.
3231	On 15 May, after Dickinson was cleared for activities, manager Rod Smallwood confirmed that the album would be released in 2015, although the band would not tour until 2016 to allow Dickinson to continue recuperating.
3232	 On 18 June 2015, the band's website announced its title, The Book of Souls, and confirmed a release date of 4 September 2015.
3233	It is the band's first original studio album not to be issued by EMI outside North America, following Parlophone's acquisition by Warner Music Group in 2013.
3234	A critical and commercial success, it received positive reviews and became the band's fifth UK No. 1 album.
3235	Smith, Harris, Murray and Gers performing in 2017.
3236	The new record was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris, which they had previously used for 2000's Brave New World, with regular producer Kevin Shirley in late summer 2014.
3237	With a total run time of 92 minutes, it is the group's first double studio album.
3238	In addition, the release's closing song, \\"Empire of the Clouds\\", penned by Dickinson, surpassed \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" (from 1984's Powerslave) as Iron Maiden's longest song, at 18 minutes in length.
3239	A music video for the song \\"Speed of Light\\" was issued on 14 August.
3240	In February 2016, the band embarked on The Book of Souls World Tour, which saw them play concerts in 35 countries in North and South America, Asia, Australasia, Africa, and Europe, including their first ever performances in China, El Salvador, and Lithuania.
3241	As with 2008-09's Somewhere Back in Time World Tour and 2010-11's The Final Frontier World Tour, the group travelled in a customised aeroplane, flown by Dickinson and nicknamed \\"Ed Force One\\", although they used a Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet.
3242	The band completed the tour in 2017 with further European and North American shows.
3243	On 20 September 2017, The Book of Souls: Live Chapter was announced.
3244	Recorded throughout The Book of Souls World Tour, it was released on 17 November 2017.
3245	In the summer of 2016, the group launched a mobile game, Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast.
3246	Inspired by the game's title, the band would undertake the Legacy of the Beast World Tour, commencing in Europe in 2018, with North and South American shows following in 2019.
3247	Image and legacyIron Maiden were ranked No. 24 in VH1's \\"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\\", No. 4 in MTV's \\"Top 10 Greatest Heavy Metal Bands of All Time\\" and No. 3 in VH1 Classic's \\"Top 20 Metal Bands\\".
3248	 The band also won the Ivor Novello Award for international achievement in 2002 and were inducted into the Hollywood RockWalk whilst touring in the US in 2005.
3249	Iron Maiden frequently use the slogan \\"Up the Irons\\" in their disc liner notes, and the phrase can also be seen on several T-shirts officially licensed by the band.
3250	It is a paraphrase of \\"Up the Hammers\\", the phrase which refers to the London football club, West Ham United, of which founder Steve Harris is a fan.
3251	Iron Maiden's mascot, Eddie, is a perennial fixture in the band's science fiction and horror-influenced album cover art, as well as in live shows.
3252	Originally a papier-mâché mask incorporated in their backdrop which would squirt fake blood during their live shows, the name would be transferred to the character featured in the band's debut album cover, created by Derek Riggs.
3253	Eddie was painted exclusively by Riggs until 1992, at which point the band began using artwork from numerous other artists as well, including Melvyn Grant.
3254	Eddie is also featured in the band's first-person shooter video game, Ed Hunter, as well as their mobile role-playing game, Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast, in addition to numerous T-shirts, posters and other band-related merchandise.
3255	In 2008, he was awarded the \\"Icon Award\\" at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods, while Gibson.com describes him as \\"the most recognisable metal icon in the world and one of the most versatile too\\".
3256	Iron Maiden's distinct logo has adorned all of the band's releases since their debut, 1979's The Soundhouse Tapes EP.
3257	The typeface originates with Vic Fair's poster design for the 1976 science fiction film, The Man Who Fell to Earth, also used by Gordon Giltrap, although Steve Harris claims that he designed it himself, using his abilities as an architectural draughtsman.
3258	Influence on other artists
3259	According to Guitar World, Iron Maiden's music has \\"influenced generations of newer metal acts, from legends like Metallica to current stars like Avenged Sevenfold,\\" with Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich commenting that he has \\"always had an incredible amount of respect and admiration for them.\\"
3260	Kerry King of Slayer stated that \\"they meant so much to [him] in their early days\\" and Scott Ian of Anthrax said that \\"they had a major impact on [his] life.
3261	\\"M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold stated that Iron Maiden \\"are by far the best live band in the world and their music is timeless\\", while Trivium singer Matt Heafy comments that \\"without Iron Maiden, Trivium surely wouldn't exist\\".
3262	Slipknot and Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor said that \\"Steve Harris does more with four fingers than I've ever seen anybody do.
3263	And Bruce Dickinson?
3264	Dude!
3265	To me, he was the quintessential old-school heavy metal singer.
3266	He could hit notes that were just sick, and he was a great showman.
3267	Everything made me a fan.
3268	And there wasn't a dude that I hung out with that wasn't trying to draw Eddie on their schoolbooks\\", while their music also helped Jesper Strömblad of In Flames to pioneer the melodic death metal genre, stating that he had wanted to combine death metal with Iron Maiden's melodic guitar sounds.
3269	Other heavy metal artists who cite the band as an influence include Chris Jericho, a WWE wrestler and lead singer of Fozzy, Cam Pipes, lead vocalist of 3 Inches of Blood, Vitaly Dubinin, bassist of Aria, and Mikael Åkerfeldt, guitarist and lead vocalist of Opeth.
3270	Both current and former Dream Theater members John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy have stated that Iron Maiden were one of their biggest influences when their band first formed.
3271	Appearance in media
3272	The band's name has been mentioned prominently in several songs, such as the singles \\"Teenage Dirtbag\\" by Wheatus, \\"Back to the 80's\\" by Danish dance-pop band Aqua.
3273	and \\"Fat Lip\\" by Sum 41.
3274	Iron Maiden have also been referenced in Weezer's \\"Heart Songs\\" (from their 2008 self-titled \\"Red\\" album), Blues Traveler's \\"Psycho Joe\\" (from 1997's Straight on till Morning), and NOFX's \\"Eddie, Bruce and Paul\\" (from their 2009 album Coaster), which Sputnikmusic describes as \\"a humorous retelling of Paul DiAnno's departure\\".
3275	In 2008, Kerrang!
3276	released Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden, an album composed of Iron Maiden cover songs performed by Metallica, Machine Head, Dream Theater, Trivium, Coheed and Cambria, Avenged Sevenfold, and other groups influenced by the band.
3277	In 2010, Maiden uniteD, an acoustic tribute band consisting of members of Ayreon, Threshold and Within Temptation, released Mind the Acoustic Pieces, a re-interpretation of the entire Piece of Mind album.
3278	Many other Iron Maiden cover albums exist (each featuring various artists), including piano, electro, string quartet and hip-hop tributes.
3279	Iron Maiden songs have been featured in the soundtracks of several video games, including Carmageddon 2, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City, Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, SSX on Tour and Madden NFL 10.
3280	Their music also appears in the Guitar Hero and Rock Band series of rhythmic video games.
3281	Iron Maiden songs have also appeared in films, such as Phenomena (entitled Creepers in the US), and Murder by Numbers; while MTV's animated duo Beavis and Butt-Head have commented favourably on the band several times.
3282	Transformers author Bill Forster is an avowed Iron Maiden fan and made several Iron Maiden references, including song lyrics and the phrase \\"Up the Irons\\" in his books, including The Ark series and The AllSpark Almanac series.
3283	Claims of Satanic referencesIn 1982, the band released one of their most popular, controversial and acclaimed albums, The Number of the Beast.
3284	The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as Satanists, encouraging people to destroy copies of the release.
3285	The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later commented that Christians initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers through fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes.
3286	The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.
3287	Contrary to the accusations, the band have always denied the notion that they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the Live After Death concert video.
3288	Steve Harris has since commented that, \\"It was mad.
3289	They completely got the wrong end of the stick.
3290	They obviously hadn't read the lyrics.
3291	They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists.\\"
3292	Harris has also stated that \\"The Number of the Beast\\" song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching Damien: Omen II, and also influenced by Robert Burns' Tam o' Shanter.
3293	Furthermore, the band's drummer, Nicko McBrain, has been a born-again Christian since 1999.
3294	Ed Force OneThe band's former Ed Force One, a Boeing 757-200.
3295	For their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour in 2008 and 2009, Iron Maiden commissioned an Astraeus Airlines Boeing 757 as transport.
3296	The aeroplane was converted into a combi configuration, which enabled it to carry the band, their crew and stage production, thereby allowing the group to perform in countries which were previously deemed unreachable logistically.
3297	It was also repainted with a special Iron Maiden livery, which the airline decided to retain after receiving positive feedback from customers.
3298	Iron Maiden's Ed Force One, a Boeing 747-400, as used during The Book of Souls World Tour in 2016.
3299	The aircraft, named \\"Ed Force One\\" after a competition on the band's website, was flown by Dickinson, as he was also a commercial airline pilot for Astraeus, and plays a major role in the award-winning documentary, Iron Maiden: Flight 666, which was released in cinemas in 42 countries in April 2009.
3300	A different aeroplane (registered G-STRX) was used for The Final Frontier World Tour in 2011 with altered livery, adopting the artwork of The Final Frontier album, and features heavily in the 2012 documentary \\"Behind the Beast\\".
3301	For The Book of Souls World Tour in 2016, the band upgraded to an ex-Air France Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet, supplied by Air Atlanta Icelandic (registered TF-AAK) and customised by Volga-Dnepr Gulf, which allows for more space without the aircraft having to undergo a significant conversion to carry their equipment.
3302	Musical style and influencesSteve Harris, Iron Maiden's bassist and primary songwriter, has stated that his influences include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull, Thin Lizzy, UFO and Wishbone Ash.
3303	In 2010 Harris stated, \\"I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, all they have to do is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album.
3304	Thin Lizzy too, but not as much.
3305	And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull.
3306	So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it.\\"
3307	In 2004, Harris explained that the band's \\"heaviness\\" was inspired by \\"Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in.\\"
3308	On top of this, Harris developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as \\"more like a rhythm guitar,\\" cited as responsible for the band's galloping style, heard in such songs as \\"The Trooper\\" and \\"Run to the Hills.
3309	\\"The band's guitarists, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, and Janick Gers, each have their own individual influences and playing style.
3310	Dave Murray is known for his legato technique which, he claims, \\"evolved naturally.
3311	I'd heard Jimi Hendrix using legato when I was growing up, and I liked that style of playing.\\"
3312	Stating that he \\"was inspired by blues rock rather than metal,\\" Adrian Smith was influenced by Johnny Winter and Pat Travers, leading to him becoming a \\"melodic player.\\"
3313	Janick Gers, on the other hand, prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by Ritchie Blackmore, which he claims is in contrast to Smith's \\"rhythmic\\" sound.
3314	Singer Bruce Dickinson, who typically works in collaboration with guitarist Adrian Smith, has an operatic vocal style, inspired by Arthur Brown, Peter Hammill, Ian Anderson and Ian Gillan, and is often considered to be one of the best heavy metal vocalists of all time.
3315	Although Nicko McBrain has only received one writing credit, on the Dance of Death album, Harris often relies on him while developing songs.
3316	Adrian Smith commented, \\"Steve loves playing with him.
3317	[They] used to work for hours going over these bass and drum patterns.
3318	\\"Throughout their career, the band's style has remained largely unchanged, in spite of the addition of guitar synthesisers on 1986's Somewhere in Time, keyboards on 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, and an attempt to return to the \\"stripped down\\" production of their earlier material on  No Prayer for the Dying.
3319	In recent years, however, the band have begun using more progressive elements in their songs, which Steve Harris describes as not progressive \\"in the modern sense, but like Dream Theater, more in a 70s way\\".
3320	According to Harris, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was the band's first album which was \\"more progressive\\", while they would only return to this style from 1995's The X Factor, which he states is \\"like an extension of Seventh Son..., in the sense of the progressive element to it\\".
3321	The development contrasts with the band's raw-sounding earlier material, which AllMusic states was \\"clearly drawing from elements of punk rock\\", although Harris firmly denies this.

3359	Its origins come from Dunn's first documentary Metal: A Headbanger's Journey, which included the acclaimed \\"Heavy Metal Family Tree.\\"
3360	SummaryMetal Evolution is broken down into episodes about a different piece of metal history.
3361	The series includes interviews with and about Alice Cooper, Slash, Lemmy, Rob Zombie, members of Megadeth, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Slayer, Judas Priest, Van Halen, Whitesnake, Def Leppard, The Stooges, ZZ Top, Soundgarden, Mötley Crüe, Poison, Rage Against the Machine, Alice in Chains, Korn, Slipknot, Lamb of God and more.
3362	History
3363	The series was created after feedback about Metal: A Headbanger's Journey debuted.
3364	\\"Some people said they wished that film was eight hours long,\\" Dunn said.
3365	The \\"Heavy Metal Family Tree\\" from the documentary heavily influenced the Metal Evolution series, with the Banger Films official blog noting that using the 26-subgenre chart as a \\"road map, host/producer and metalhead turned anthropologist Sam Dunn, crisscrossed the globe exploring the vast history of heavy metal across its 40+ year history and beyond.\\"
3366	EpisodesEp #TitleAirdateHeavy Metal Family TreeFor Metal Evolution, Sam Dunn presented a new, updated version of his \\"Heavy Metal Family Tree,\\" a 26-subgenre chart that mapped out metal's various subgenres that have spawned over the course of its 40-year history.
3367	This new, more elaborate version included a \\"Pre-History of Metal\\" field that listed non-metal musicians that had an influence on heavy metal.
3368	It also listed additional bands as examples of the various styles of metal.
3369	Some (but not all) of the subgenres were shown over the course of the series.

3376	Jeff DanielsJulian SandsHarley Jane KozakJohn GoodmanTrevor JonesMikael SalomonMichael KahnHollywood PicturesAmblin EntertainmentTangled Web ProductionsBuena Vista Pictures110 minutesUnited StatesEnglish$22 million$53.2 millionArachnophobia is a 1990 American black comedy horror film directed by Frank Marshall and starring Jeff Daniels and John Goodman.
3377	It was the first film released by The Walt Disney Studios' Hollywood Pictures label, as well as being the directorial debut of Marshall.
3378	The film's story centers on a newly discovered Venezuelan spider being transported to a small American town that produces a new species of deadly spiders, which begin killing the town's residents one by one.
3379	Shooting took place in Venezuela and California and the film was released in the United States on July 18, 1990.
3380	It was a modest commercial success, gaining $53.21 million at the box office and received generally positive reviews from critics.
3381	PlotEntomologist Dr. James Atherton searches the Amazon rainforest with the hope of discovering new species of insects and arachnids.
3382	In a Venezuelan tepui, Atherton finds a very aggressive new species of spider.
3383	The spider is captured and chloroformed for research, and is later revealed to be lacking sex organs, thus making it a drone, or soldier - atypical in spiders.
3384	A nature photographer, Jerry Manley, unknowingly has a fertile (non-drone) male spider of the same species jump into his backpack, later that day sneaking into his sleeping bag and biting him.
3385	Manley has a massive seizure from the venom and dies.
3386	The remainder of the scientists take his body back to the United States, blaming Manley's death on a fever.
3387	The spider crawls into the coffin and is sealed in with the corpse.
3388	Manley's desiccated body arrives at the funeral home in his hometown of Canaima, California.
3389	The spider makes it outside, only to be picked by a crow until the spider bites it and it falls to the ground dead, in front of the barn of the Jennings family.
3390	Ross Jennings is a family physician, who had moved to the town from San Francisco.
3391	He and his son both have arachnophobia.
3392	Ross faces a lack of patients due to elderly rival Sam Metcalf, who was supposed to retire and shift his patients to Ross, but decided to maintain his practice.
3393	The Amazonian spider mates with a female domestic house spider and makes a nest in Jennings' barn, producing hundreds of infertile drone offspring, all of which have their father’s lethal bite.
3394	Ross' first patient, kindly widower Margaret Hollins, dies after being bitten by one of the new spiders.
3395	Metcalf diagnoses a heart attack, although Ross suspects something else was at work.
3396	Metcalf suspects Ross is guilty of malpractice, as Ross had taken Margaret off the medication Metcalf had prescribed for her when she was his patient.
3397	A spider also kills a high school football player, Todd Miller, just after Ross had performed a routine check on the team, earning him the town nickname \\"Dr. Death\\".
3398	The next victim is Sam Metcalf, who is bitten in his own bedroom and dies in front of his wife.
3399	With Metcalf dead, Ross becomes Canaima's town doctor.
3400	Knowing Metcalf was bitten by a spider just before his fatal seizure, and that a minute amount of an unknown toxin was detected in his body, Ross suspects deadly arachnids could be infesting the town, and wants to perform autopsies on the recently deceased.
3401	Ross and county coroner Milton Briggs perform an autopsy on the victims and confirm Ross' suspicion that the deaths were caused by spider bites.
3402	Ross contacts Dr. Atherton and asks him to aid his investigation, given he is the country's leading expert in spiders.
3403	Atherton is sceptical that spiders could be the cause of the deaths, and instead of travelling to Cainama himself, he sends one of his assistants, Chris Collins.
3404	Chris is initially sceptical, but is convinced there is a deadly strain of spiders in Cainama after the corpses of Margaret Hollins, Todd Miller, and Sam Metcalf all exhibit spider bites.
3405	Ross and Chris manage to catch a live specimen of one of the spiders.
3406	When Chris mentions the new species of spider Atherton had discovered in Venezuela, Ross realises that one of the Venezuelan spiders \\"hitched a ride in Manley's coffin.
3407	\\"After being contacted by Chris, Atherton arrives in Cainama and joins Ross, Chris, Milt Briggs, local Sheriff Lloyd Parsons and exterminator Delbert McClintock in the spider investigation.
3408	They discover the killer spiders have a short life expectancy due to being a mixed breed.
3409	Atherton tells them the spiders are soldiers, sent out to eliminate potential threats for lead male spider, \\"the General.\\"
3410	He also learns that the General produced a queen, which it likely mated with to produce a second nest someplace, guarded by the queen, which could produce fertile offspring.
3411	Atherton elaborates that the transplanted spiders can progressively expand their territory, possibly culminating in their worldwide dispersal.
3412	The group sets out to destroy both nests and kill the Queen and the General.
3413	Deducing that one of the nests is in his barn, Ross sends Delbert to destroy it.
3414	Delbert finds Atherton dead, having been bitten by the General after disturbing the web.
3415	Ross and Chris discover the spiders have killed local mortician Irv Kendall and his wife Blaire (both of whom were killed whilst watching Wheel of Fortune on television).
3416	Chris gets the Jennings family out of their infested house, but Ross falls through the floor into his wine cellar, which turns out to be the spiders' second nest, guarded not only by the Queen but also the General.
3417	After electrocuting the queen, Ross battles the General while also attempting to burn the second egg sac.
3418	Ross becomes trapped underneath fallen debris, with the General about to deliver the killing strike.
3419	Ross finally overcomes his paralytic fear of spiders by summoning up his strength to fling the General into the fire.
3420	As the egg sac hatches, the General jumps out of the fire.
3421	Ross shoots it with a nail gun and the projectile sends the burning spider into the egg sac, destroying the nest with fire.
3422	Delbert retrieves Ross from the burning cellar.
3423	With the death of the General and the Queen, the egg sac destroyed, and the drones either killed by Delbert or left to die due to their reduced lifespan, the spider plague is over.
3424	The Jennings family immediately moves back to San Francisco, appreciating city life once more, despite such minor inconveniences as earthquakes (one of which manages to spill Ross' prized bottle of Château Margaux which he had managed to rescue from his burned cellar).

3426	Spielberg and Marshall are both the executive producers of the film.
3427	Amblin Entertainment also helped produce it.
3428	Marshall meant for the film to be like Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, and added, \\"People like to be scared but laughing, like a roller coaster.
3429	No one wants to be terrified.\\"
3430	The film also has similarities with the 1977 film Kingdom of the Spiders.
3431	Producer Igo Kantor hinted in his Fangoria interview that Arachnophobia, which Spielberg produced, bears several similarities to Kingdom of the Spiders.
3432	\\"I thought it was a copy\\", Kantor stated, \\"but you don't go and sue Spielberg!\\"
3433	Jamie Hyneman, of MythBusters fame, stated in Popular Mechanics that Arachnophobia was one of the first movies he worked on and that he often relied on simple magnets for several of the effects.
3434	The film made use of over 300 Avondale spiders, from New Zealand, which were picked for their large size, unusually social lifestyle, and because they are essentially harmless to humans.
3435	They were guided around the set by the use of heat and cold, but the large \\"general\\" and \\"queen\\" were articulated models.
3436	The movie was actually filmed in Southern Venezuela for the intro sequence and the jungle scenes, as well as Cambria, California.
3437	All the school scenes were filmed at Coast Union High School.
3438	Students and staff were used in the football scenes and group events.
3439	The locker room and players were the actual students and players from CUHS.
3440	To create the sound effects of spiders being stepped on or squished, Foley artists stepped on mustard packs or squashed potato chips.
3441	Release and receptionArachnophobia was the first film released by Hollywood Pictures.
3442	Advertisers were uncertain as to whether they should market the film as a thriller or a comedy.
3443	Therefore, television spots promoting the film billed it as a \\"thrill-omedy\\".
3444	Box officeArachnophobia debuted at #3 behind Ghost and Die Hard 2 with $8 million in its first weekend.
3445	The film was a financial success, grossing $53,208,180 domestically and going on to gross an additional $30,000,000 in video rentals.
3446	This allowed Spielberg to be the fourth wealthiest entertainer of the year, having previously been the second wealthiest.
3447	CriticsIn his book, critic Leonard Maltin calls the film a \\"slick comic thriller\\" and approves of the acting, warning, \\"Not recommended for anyone who's ever covered their eyes during a movie.\\"
3448	Newsweek associated the film with B movies \\"about the small town threatened by alien invaders\\", and said it was well made but \\"oddly unresonant.\\"
3449	Roger Ebert said the film made audiences \\"squirm out of enjoyment, not terror\\", giving it three stars out of four.
3450	On the review website Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 36 reviews, and an average rating of 6.8/10.
3451	The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Arachnophobia may not deliver genuine chills, but it's an affectionate, solidly built tribute to Hollywood's classic creature features.
3452	\\"The film drew protests from some people interested in spiders, as they believed the film tarnished the public image of spiders.

3454	The film was first released on VHS in 1991.
3455	It was then released as a bare bones DVD in 1999.
3456	The film was released on Blu-ray on September 25, 2012.
3457	VHS and DVD releases by Hollywood/Buena Vista Home Video curiously omit the original poster art's spider from their cover design, however the Blu-ray now reinstates it.
3458	MerchandisingArachnophobiafilmTrevor JonesJuly 18, 1990 (original release)March 19, 1996 (re-release)Evergreen Recording StudiosHollywood RecordsUnusually, the video game version of Arachnophobia was also released in 1991, for Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and DOS.
3459	A novelization of Arachnophobia was written by author Nicholas Edwards.
3460	Hollywood Comics (an imprint of Disney Comics) released a comic book adaptation of the film, written by William Rotsler with art by Dan Spiegle.
3461	Notably, the characters in the comic adaptation bear little resemblance to the actors in the film.
3462	An Arachnophobia soundtrack album was released in 1990.
3463	It included Trevor Jones's instrumental music from the film as well as dialogue excerpts and songs such as \\"Blue Eyes Are Sensitive to the Light\\" by Sara Hickman, \\"Caught in Your Web (Swear to Your Heart)\\" by Russell Hitchcock, and \\"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\\" by Tony Bennett.
3464	The European version of the album has the same cover art, but more score tracks, fewer songs and no dialogue.
3465	The two versions share 10 of the same tracks, but these are also not without their differences: several tracks are noticeably shorter on the European version like \\"Canaima Nightmare\\", which is nearly three minutes shorter; and another track has two different titles (\\"Cellar Theme\\" in America and \\"The Cellar\\" in Europe).
3466	Possible remake
3467	According to Geek Tyrant, James Wan, one of Hollywood's famed directors, the film is currently in the process of a remake.
3468	 He is teaming up with Amblin for the works.
3469	Wan has directed numerous horror films including Saw, Insidious, and The Conjuring.

3473	And Then There Were None]Murder Is EasySad Cypress
3474	And Then There Were None is a mystery novel by English writer Agatha Christie, her best selling novel and described by her as the most difficult of her books to write.
3475	It was first published in the United Kingdom by the Collins Crime Club on 6 November 1939, as Ten Little Niggers, after the British blackface song, which serves as a major plot point.
3476	The US edition was released in January 1940 with the title
3477	And Then There Were None, which is taken from the last five words of the song.
3478	 All successive American reprints and adaptations use that title, except for the Pocket Books paperbacks published between 1964 and 1986, which appeared under the title Ten Little Indians.
3479	The book is the world's best-selling mystery, and with over 100 million copies sold is one of the best-selling books of all time.
3480	Publications International lists the novel as the sixth best-selling title.
3481	Plot summary
3482	On a hot 8 August in the late 1930s, eight people arrive on a small, isolated island off the Devon coast of England.
3483	Each has an invitation tailored to his or her personal circumstances, such as an offer of employment or an unexpected late summer holiday.
3484	They are met by Thomas and Ethel Rogers, the butler and cook-housekeeper, who state that their hosts, Mr Ulick Norman Owen and his wife Mrs Una Nancy Owen, whom they have not yet met in person, have not arrived, but left instructions, which strikes all the guests as odd.
3485	A framed copy of a nursery rhyme, \\"Ten Little Niggers\\" (called \\"Ten Little Indians\\" or \\"Ten Little Soldiers\\" in later editions), hangs in every guest's room, and ten figurines sit on the dining room table.
3486	After supper, a gramophone (or \\"phonograph\\") record is played;  the recording describes each visitor in turn, accuses each of having committed murder but escaping justice, and then asks if any of \\"the accused\\" wishes to offer a defence.
3487	All but Anthony Marston and Philip Lombard deny the charges, and Miss Brent refuses to discuss the matter.
3488	They discover that none of them actually knows the Owens, and Justice Wargrave concludes that the name \\"U.N. Owen\\" is shorthand for \\"Unknown\\".
3489	After the recording, Marston finishes his drink and immediately dies from cyanide poisoning.
3490	The remaining guests notice that one of the ten figurines is now broken, and the nursery rhyme appears to reflect the manner of death (\\"One choked his little self and then there were nine\\").
3491	The next morning, Mrs Rogers' corpse is found in her bed; she had died in her sleep from an overdose of chloral hydrate.
3492	By lunchtime, General MacArthur is found dead, from a heavy blow to his head.
3493	Two more figurines are found to be broken, and again the deaths parallel the rhyme.
3494	Miss Brent relates the account of the gramophone charge against her to Vera Claythorne, who later tells the others.
3495	A search for Mr Owen shows that nobody else is on the island except the remaining seven.
3496	The island is a \\"bare rock\\" with no hiding places, and no one could have arrived or left; thus, they conclude that any one of the seven remaining persons is the killer.
3497	Wargrave leads the group in determining that so far, none of them can definitively be ruled out as the murderer.
3498	The next morning, Rogers is found dead while chopping wood, and after breakfast, Miss Brent is found dead in the kitchen, where she had been left alone after complaining of feeling unwell; she had been injected with potassium cyanide via a hypodermic needle.
3499	Wargrave then suggests searching all the rooms, and any potentially dangerous items they can think of are locked up.
3500	Lombard's gun is missing from his room.
3501	When Vera goes upstairs to take a bath, she is shocked by the touch and smell of seaweed left hanging from the ceiling of her room and screams; the remaining guests rush upstairs to her room.
3502	Wargrave, however, is still downstairs.
3503	The others find him seated, immobile and crudely dressed up in the attire of a judge.
3504	Wargrave is examined briefly by Dr Armstrong and pronounced dead from a gunshot to the forehead.
3505	That night, Lombard appears surprised when he finds his gun returned to his room.
3506	Blore catches a glimpse of someone leaving the house but loses the trail.
3507	He then discovers Armstrong is absent from his room, and the remaining three guests conclude that Armstrong must be the killer.
3508	Vera, Blore, and Lombard decide to stay together at all times.
3509	In the morning, they signal ]] to the mainland from outside by using a [[Mirror#Signalling|mirror and sunlight, but receive no reply.
3510	Blore then returns to the house for food by himself and is killed by a heavy bear-shaped clock statue that is pushed from Vera's window sill, crushing his skull.
3511	Vera and Lombard are now confident that Armstrong is the killer.
3512	However, shortly afterwards, the duo come upon Armstrong's body washed up on the beach.
3513	They realize that Armstrong could not have killed Blore.
3514	Panicked, each concludes the other must be the killer.
3515	Quickly regaining her composure, Vera suggests moving the doctor's body past the shore, but this is a pretext.
3516	She lifts Lombard's gun.
3517	When Lombard lunges at her to get it back, she shoots him dead.
3518	She returns to the house in a shaken dreamlike state, relieved to be alive.
3519	She finds a noose and chair arranged in her room, and a strong smell of the sea.
3520	With visions of her former lover Hugo urging her on, she adjusts the noose and kicks the chair out from under her.
3521	Two Scotland Yard officials are puzzled by the identity of U N Owen.
3522	Although they can partially reconstruct the deaths from Marston to Wargrave with the help of the victims' diaries and a coroner's careful report, they conclude that U N  Owen was one of the victims, but are unable to determine which one; they also think that none of the last four victims (Armstrong, Blore, Lombard, or Claythorne) can be U N Owen at all; for example The chair on which Vera stood to hang herself had been set back upright, indicating that someone was still alive on the island after her suicide, presumably the killer.
3523	Postscript from the Killer
3524	In a postscript, a fishing ship picks up a bottle inside its trawling nets; the bottle contains a written confession of the killings, which is then sent to Scotland Yard.
3525	It is not known how long after the killings the bottle was discovered.
3526	In the confession, Justice Wargrave writes that he has long wished to set an unsolvable puzzle of murder.
3527	His victims would be of his choosing, as they were not found guilty in a trial.
3528	He explains how he tricked Dr Armstrong, who trusted the judge, into helping him fake his own death under the pretext that it would help the group identify the killer.
3529	He explains that he replaced the chair in Vera's room.
3530	Finally, he reveals how he used the gun and some elastic to ensure his own death matched the account in the guests' diaries.
3531	Although he wished to create an unsolvable mystery, he acknowledges in the missive a \\"pitiful human need\\" for recognition, hence the confession.
3532	He describes how his first victim was Isaac Morris, the sleazy lawyer and drug trafficker who anonymously purchased the island and arranged the invitations on his behalf, making nine murders and two suicides.
3533	Morris was poisoned before Wargrave departed for the island.
3534	Wargrave's intention is to stymie the police as to which person on the island was the murderer.
3535	He states that, although there are three clues that could guide the police to the correct killer, he is confident the mystery will remain unsolved until the confession is read.
3536	CharactersThe following details of the characters are based on the original novel published in England.
3537	Anthony James Marston, an amoral and irresponsible young man, killed two young children (John and Lucy Combes) while driving recklessly, for which he felt no real remorse and accepted no personal responsibility, complaining only that his driving licence had been suspended as a result.
3538	He was the first island victim.
3539	Mrs Ethel Rogers, the cook/housekeeper and Thomas Rogers' wife, described as a pale and ghost-like woman who walks in mortal fear.
3540	She was dominated by her bullying husband, who coerced her into agreeing to withhold the medicine of a former employer (Miss Jennifer Brady, an elderly spinster) in order that they might collect an inheritance they knew she had left them in her will.
3541	Mrs Rogers was the second victim.
3542	General John Gordon MacArthur, a retired World War I war hero, who sent his late wife's lover (a younger officer, Arthur Richmond) to his death by assigning him to a mission where it was practically guaranteed he would not survive.
3543	Leslie MacArthur had mistakenly put the wrong letters in the envelopes on one occasion when she wrote to both men at the same time.
3544	The general tells Vera that no one will leave the island alive.
3545	Thomas Rogers, the butler and Ethel Rogers' husband.
3546	He dominated his weak-willed wife, and they killed their former elderly employer by withholding her medicine, causing the woman to die from heart failure, thus inheriting the money she bequeathed them in her will.
3547	Despite his wife's death, Rogers was still serving the others.
3548	Emily Caroline Brent, an elderly, religiously rigid, socially respectable spinster who accepted the vacation on Soldier Island largely due to financial constraints.
3549	Years earlier, she had dismissed her teenage maid, Beatrice Taylor, for becoming pregnant out of wedlock.
3550	Beatrice, who had already been rejected by her parents for the same reason, drowned herself, which Miss Brent considered an even worse sin.
3551	The murderer put a bee into the room, in addition to murder by poison.
3552	(\\"A bumblebee stung one...\\")
3553	Dr Edward George Armstrong, a Harley Street doctor, responsible for the death of a patient, Louisa Mary Clees, after he operated on her while drunk many years earlier.
3554	William Henry Blore, a former police inspector and now a private investigator, was accused of falsifying his testimony in court for a bribe from a dangerous criminal gang, which resulted in an innocent man, James Landor, being convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.
3555	Landor, who had a wife and young child, died shortly afterwards in prison.
3556	Blore arrived under the alias \\"Davis\\" from South Africa, on the island for \\"security work.\\"
3557	His true name is revealed on the gramophone recording.
3558	He denies the accusation against him from the gramophone recording, but later admits the truth to Lombard.
3559	Philip Lombard, a soldier of fortune.
3560	Literally down to his last square meal when he met Isaac Morris who made the proposition which brought Lombard to the island, he carries a loaded revolver, as Morris had hinted he might wish to do.
3561	Lombard is accused of causing the deaths of a number of East African tribesmen, after stealing their food and abandoning them to their deaths.
3562	Neither he nor Marston feels any remorse.
3563	He is the only one to theorize that U N Owen might be Wargrave, but the others reject this.
3564	He and Vera are the only victims not killed by Justice Wargrave.
3565	Vera Elizabeth Claythorne, a cool, efficient, resourceful young woman who is on leave from her position as a sports mistress at a third-rate girls' school.
3566	Her job as a governess was ended by the death of her charge, Cyril Hamilton.
3567	Claythorne let the boy drown so his uncle Hugo Hamilton could inherit the family estate and marry her.
3568	Hugo rejected her when he somehow realized what she had done.
3569	Justice Lawrence John Wargrave, a retired judge, known as a \\"hanging judge\\" for liberally awarding the death penalty in murder cases.
3570	Wargrave is accused of influencing the jury to hand a guilty verdict to Edward Seton, a man many thought was innocent of his crime of killing an old woman, and sentencing him to death unfairly.
3571	As the two policemen discuss at Scotland Yard, new evidence after Seton's execution proved Seton's guilt.
3572	Wargrave admits in his postscript that he has a lifelong hidden sadistic urge to kill, but only the guilty.
3573	Finding himself terminally ill, he devises and carries out this plot.
3574	Isaac Morris is a sleazy and unethical lawyer hired by Wargrave to purchase the island (under the name U N Owen), arrange the gramophone recording, and make arrangements on his behalf, including gathering information on the near destitute Philip Lombard, to whom he gave some money to get by and recommended Lombard bring his gun to the island.
3575	Morris's is the first death chronologically, as he died before the guests arrived on the island.
3576	Morris was responsible for the addiction and suicide of a young woman through his narcotics activities.
3577	The victim was the daughter of a friend of Wargrave.
3578	A hypochondriac, Morris accepted a lethal cocktail of pills from Wargrave to help treat his largely self-imagined physical ailments.
3579	Fred Narracott, the boatman who delivered the guests to the island.
3580	After doing so, he does not appear again in the story, although Inspector Maine notes it was Narracott who, sensing something seriously amiss, returned to the island as soon as the weather allowed, before he was scheduled to do so, and found the bodies.
3581	Maine speculates that it was the normalcy and ordinariness of the guests that convinced Narracott to do so and ignore his orders to dismiss any signals requesting help.
3582	Sir Thomas Legge and Inspector Maine, two Scotland Yard detectives who discuss the case in the epilogue.
3583	They reason out the events of the case, but are stymied as to which was the murderer until the confession comes to light.
3584	Literary significance and reception
3585	Writing for The Times Literary Supplement of 11 November 1939, Maurice Percy Ashley stated, \\"If her latest story has scarcely any detection in it there is no scarcity of murders...
3586	There is a certain feeling of monotony inescapable in the regularity of the deaths which is better suited to a serialized newspaper story than a full-length novel.
3587	Yet there is an ingenious problem to solve in naming the murderer\\", he continued.
3588	\\"It will be an extremely astute reader who guesses correctly.
3589	\\"For The New York Times Book Review (25 February 1940), Isaac Anderson has arrived to the point where \\"the voice\\" accuses the ten \\"guests\\" of their past crimes, which have all resulted in the deaths of humans, and then said, \\"When you read what happens after that you will not believe it, but you will keep on reading, and as one incredible event is followed by another even more incredible you will still keep on reading.
3590	The whole thing is utterly impossible and utterly fascinating.
3591	It is the most baffling mystery that Agatha Christie has ever written, and if any other writer has ever surpassed it for sheer puzzlement the name escapes our memory.
3592	We are referring, of course, to mysteries that have logical explanations, as this one has.
3593	It is a tall story, to be sure, but it could have happened.
3594	\\"Many compared the book to her novel The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (1926).
3595	For instance, an unnamed reviewer in the Toronto Daily Star of 16 March 1940 said, \\"Others have written better mysteries than Agatha Christie, but no one can touch her for ingenious plot and surprise ending.
3596	With And Then There Were None... she is at her most ingenious and most surprising... is, indeed, considerably above the standard of her last few works and close to the Roger Ackroyd level.\\"
3597	Other critics laud the use of plot twists and surprise endings.
3598	Maurice Richardson wrote a rhapsodic review in The Observer's issue of 5 November 1939 which began, \\"No wonder Agatha Christie's latest has sent her publishers into a vatic  trance.
3599	We will refrain, however, from any invidious comparisons with Roger Ackroyd and be content with saying that Ten Little Niggers is one of the very best, most genuinely bewildering Christies yet written.
3600	We will also have to refrain from reviewing it thoroughly, as it is so full of shocks that even the mildest revelation would spoil some surprise from somebody, and I am sure that you would rather have your entertainment kept fresh than criticism pure.\\"
3601	After stating the set-up of the plot, Richardson concluded, \\"Story telling and characterisation are right at the top of Mrs Christie's baleful form.
3602	Her plot may be highly artificial, but it is neat, brilliantly cunning, soundly constructed, and free from any of those red-herring false trails which sometimes disfigure her work.
3603	\\"Robert Barnard, a recent critic, concurred with the reviews, describing the book as \\"Suspenseful and menacing detective-story-cum-thriller.
3604	The closed setting with the succession of deaths is here taken to its logical conclusion, and the dangers of ludicrousness and sheer reader-disbelief are skillfully avoided.
3605	Probably the best-known Christie, and justifiably among the most popular.
3606	\\"The original title of the mystery (Ten Little Niggers) was changed because it was offensive in the United States and some other places.
3607	 Alison Light, a literary critic and feminist scholar, opined that Christie's original title and the setting on \\"Nigger Island\\" (later changed to \\"Indian Island\\" and \\"Soldier Island\\", variously) were integral to the work.
3608	These aspects of the novel, she argued, \\"could be relied upon automatically to conjure up a thrilling 'otherness', a place where revelations about the 'dark side' of the English would be appropriate.\\"
3609	Unlike novels such as Heart of Darkness, \\"Christie's location is both more domesticated and privatized, taking for granted the construction of racial fears woven into psychic life as early as the nursery.
3610	If her story suggests how easy it is to play upon such fears, it is also a reminder of how intimately tied they are to sources of pleasure and enjoyment.

3642	The titleCover of first US 1940 edition with current title for all English-language versions.
3643	The novel was originally published in late 1939 and early 1940 almost simultaneously, in the United Kingdom and the United States.
3644	In the UK it appeared under the title Ten Little Niggers, in book and newspaper serialized formats.
3645	The serialization was in 23 parts in the Daily Express from Tuesday 6 June to Saturday 1 July 1939.
3646	All of the instalments carried an illustration by \\"Prescott\\" with the first having an illustration of Burgh Island in Devon which inspired the setting of the story.
3647	The serialized version did not contain any chapter divisions.
3648	The book retailed for seven shillings and six pence.
3649	In the United States it was published under the title
3650	And Then There Were None, again in both book and serial formats.
3651	Both of the original US publications changed the title from that originally used in the UK, due to the offensiveness of the word in American culture, where it was more widely perceived as a racially loaded ethnic slur or insult compared to the contemporaneous culture in the United Kingdom.
3652	The serialized version appeared in the Saturday Evening Post in seven parts from 20 May (Volume 211, Number 47) to 1 July 1939 (Volume 212, Number 1) with illustrations by Henry Raleigh, and the book was published in January 1940 by Dodd, Mead and Company for $2.
3653	In the original UK novel all references to \\"Indians\\" or \\"Soldiers\\" were originally \\"Nigger\\", including the island's name, the pivotal rhyme found by the visitors, and the ten figurines.
3654	(In Chapter 7, Vera Claythorne becomes semi-hysterical at the mention by Miss Brent of \\"our black brothers\\", which is understandable only in the context of the original name).
3655	UK editions changed to the current definitive title in 1985.
3656	The word \\"nigger\\" was already racially offensive in the United States by the start of the 20th century, and therefore the book's first US edition and first serialization changed the title to
3657	And Then There Were None and removed all references to the word from the book, as did the 1945 motion picture.
3658	Sensitivity to the original title of the novel was remarked by Sadie Stein in 2016, commenting on a BBC mini series with the title
3659	And Then There Were None, where she noted that the original title of the novel \\"Even in 1939, this title was considered too offensive for American publication.\\"
3660	In general, \\"Christie’s work is not known for its racial sensitivity, and by modern standards her oeuvre is rife with casual Orientalism.\\"
3661	The original title was based on a rhyme from minstrel shows and children's games, \\"a rhyme so macabre and distressing one doesn’t hear it now outside of the Agatha Christie context.\\"
3662	Stein quotes Alison Light as to the power of the original name of the island in the novel, Nigger Island, \\"to conjure up a thrilling ‘otherness’, a place where revelations about the ‘dark side’ of the English would be appropriate\\".
3663	Speaking of the \\"widely known\\" 1945 movie, Stein added that \\"we’re merely faced with fantastic amounts of violence, and a rhyme so macabre and distressing one doesn’t hear it now outside of the Agatha Christie context.\\"
3664	She felt that the original title of the novel in the UK, seen now, \\"that original title, it jars, viscerally.\\"Publication historyThis is the best selling crime novel of all time, and what makes Agatha Christie the best selling novelist.
3665	It is Christie's best-selling novel, with more than 100 million copies sold; it is also the world's best-selling mystery and one of the best-selling books of all time.
3666	Publications International lists the novel as the sixth best-selling title.
3667	The book and its adaptations have been released under various new names since the original publication, including Ten Little Indians (1946 play, Broadway performance and 1964 paperback book), Ten Little Soldiers and official title per the Agatha Christie Limited website, And Then There Were None.
3668	UK editions continued to use the work's original title until the 1980s; the first UK edition to use the alternative title And Then There Were None appeared in 1985 with a reprint of the 1963 Fontana Paperback.

3697	Foreign language editionsThe sensitivity of the original British title varies across nations, depending on their culture and which words are used to describe people by skin colour.
3698	In the US, the British title was considered offensive at first publication, and changed to the last line of the rhyme instead of its title.
3699	As the estate of Agatha Christie now offers it under one title only in English, And Then There Were None, it is likely that new foreign language editions will match that title in their language.
3700	The original title (Ten Little Niggers) still survives in a few foreign-language versions of the novel, such as the Bulgarian title Десет малки негърчета, and was used in other languages for a time, for example in Dutch until the 1994 release of the 18th edition.
3701	The title Ten Little Negroes continues to be commonly used in foreign-language versions, for example in Spanish, Greek, Serbian, Romanian, French and Hungarian, as well as a 1987 Russian film adaptation Десять негритят (Desyat Negrityat).
3702	In 1999, the Slovak National Theatre staged the play under its original title but changed to A napokon nezostal už nik (And Then There Were None) mid-run.
3703	Possible inspirationsThe 1930 novel The Invisible Host by Gwen Bristow and Bruce Manning has a plot that strongly matches that of Christie's later novel, including a recorded voice announcing to the guests that their sins will be visited upon them by death.
3704	 The Invisible Host was adapted as the 1930 Broadway The Ninth Guest by Owen Davis, which itself was adapted as the 1934 film The Ninth Guest.
3705	There is no evidence Christie saw either the play (which had a brief run on Broadway) or the film.
3706	The 1933 K.B.S. Productions Sherlock Holmes film A Study in Scarlet follows a strikingly similar plot; it includes a scene where Holmes is shown a card with the hint: \\"Six little Indians ....bee stung one and then there were five\\".
3707	In this case, the rhyme refers to \\"Ten Little Fat Boys\\".
3708	(The film's plot bears no resemblance to Arthur Conan Doyle's original story of the same name.)
3709	The author of the movie's screenplay, Robert Florey, \\"doubted that [Christie] had seen A Study in Scarlet, but he regarded it as a compliment if it had helped inspire her\\".
3710	Adaptations
3711	And Then There Were None has had more adaptations than any other single work by Agatha Christie.
3712	It is the isolated location where all the players on scene are murdered, never knowing who their murderer is, that is the idea.
3713	\\"It was an idea which is now the basis for many Hollywood horror films and has become a cliché to modern audiences, but it was Agatha Christie who was the first to do it and so successfully that the story has become her most adapted piece.\\"
3714	She changed the bleak ending to a more palatable one for theatre audiences when she adapted the novel for the stage in 1943.
3715	Many adaptations incorporate changes to the story, such as using Christie's alternative ending from her stage play or changing the setting to locations other than an island.
3716	With a plot line so well known, parodies and references to the novel or the play are frequent.
3717	Many television programs use the essence of the plot, a group of characters cut off from the outside world with a murderer in their midst, (sometimes with innocent victims in place of guilty victims), and give no credit to Agatha Christie for the many similarities in plot and motivation.
3718	FilmThere have been numerous film adaptations of the novel, some comedic.
3719	Examples include:
3720	And Then There Were None (1945 film), René Clair's cinema adaptation was a successful US productionTen Little Indians (1965 film) is George Pollock's cinema adaptationGumnaam (1965, translation:
3721	Unknown or Anonymous) is an Indian suspense thriller film adaptation.
3722	Five Dolls for an August Moon (1970) is a loose Italian giallo adaptation directed by Mario Bava.
3723	Nadu Iravil (1970, translation: In the middle of the night), a Tamil adaptation directed by Sundaram Balachander
3724	And Then There Were None (1974 film), the first English-language colour version, directed by Peter CollinsonDesyat' Negrityat (1987, Десять негритят, Eng: \\"Ten Little Negroes\\") Stanislav Govorukhin's Russian adaptation keeps intact Christie's grim storyline and ending.
3725	Ten Little Indians, a 1989 American version directed by Alan BirkinshawAduthathu (2012) is a Tamil adaptationAatagara (2015) is a Kannada film adaptationRadioThe BBC broadcast Ten Little Niggers (1947), adapted by Ayton Whitaker, first aired as a Monday Matinee on the BBC Home Service on 27 December 1947 and as Saturday Night Theatre on the BBC Light Programme on 29 December.
3726	On 13 November 2010, as part of its Saturday Play series, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 90-minute adaptation written by Joy Wilkinson.
3727	The production was directed by Mary Peate and featured, among others, Geoffrey Whitehead as Justice Wargrave, Lyndsey Marshal as Vera Claythorne, Alex Wyndham as Philip Lombard, John Rowe as Dr. Armstrong, and Joanna Monro as Emily Brent.
3728	In this production, which is extremely faithful to the novel, the rhyme is \\"Ten Little Soldier Boys\\".
3729	Stage
3730	And Then There Were None (1943 play) is Christie's adaptation of the story for the stage.
3731	She and the producers agreed that audiences might not flock to a tale with such a grim ending as the novel, nor would it work well dramatically as there would be no one left to tell the story.
3732	Thus, she reworked the ending for Lombard and Vera to be innocent of the crimes of which they were accused, survive, and fall in love with each other.
3733	Some of the names were also changed, e.g., General Macarthur became General McKenzie in both the New York and London productions.
3734	By 1943, General Douglas MacArthur was playing a prominent role in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, which may explain the change of the character's name.
3735	Regardless of the reason, it was changed.
3736	Ten little niggers (1944 play), Dundee Repertory Theatre Company was given special permission to restore the original ending of the novel.
3737	The company first performed a stage adaptation of the novel in August 1944 under the UK title of the novel, with Agatha Christie credited as the dramatist.
3738	It was the first performance in repertory theatre.
3739	It was staged again in 1965.
3740	There was an article in the Dundee Evening Register in August 1944 
3741	And Then There Were None (2005 play), On 14 October 2005, a new version of the play, written by Kevin Elyot and directed by Steven Pimlott, opened at the Gielgud Theatre in London.
3742	For this version, Elyot returned to the original story in the novel, restoring the nihilism of the original.
3743	TelevisionSeveral variations of the original novel were adapted for television, three of which were British adaptations.
3744	The first of these, in 1949, was produced by the BBC.
3745	The second was produced in 1959, by ITV.
3746	 Both of those productions aired with Christie's original title.
3747	The third and most recent British adaptation aired as
3748	And Then There Were None on BBC One in December 2015, as a mini-series produced in cooperation with Acorn Media and Agatha Christie Productions.
3749	 The 2015 production adhered more closely to the original plot, though there were several differences, and was the first English language film adaptation to feature an ending similar to that of the novel.
3750	On 25 and 26 March 2017 TV Asahi in Japan aired そして誰もいなくなった (Soshite daremo inakunatta), a Japanese language adaptation by Nagasaka Shukei (長坂秀佳) of the original story set in modern times.
3751	Other media
3752	The novel has been the inspiration for several video games.
3753	 For the Apple II, Online Systems released the game Mystery House in 1980.
3754	 On the PC, The Adventure Company released the video game Agatha Christie:
3755	And Then There Were None in 2005, the first in a series of PC games based on Christie novels.
3756	In February 2008, it was ported to the Wii console.
3757	The identity of the murderer is not that of the killer in the original book.
3758	The game player assumes the role of Patrick Naracott (brother of Fred Naracott, who is involved in a newly created subplot), who is stranded with the others when his boat is scuttled.
3759	This allows for alternate, more successful endings in which Naracott survives and is able to prevent the murders of the innocent Lombard and Claythorne.
3760	All endings depart markedly from the novel and previous adaptations in that the killer and motives are different.
3761	And Then There Were None was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 30 April 2009, adapted by François Rivière and illustrated by Frank Leclercq.
3762	Peká Editorial released a board game based on the book, created by Judit Hurtado and Fernando Chavarría, and illustrated by Esperanza Peinado.
