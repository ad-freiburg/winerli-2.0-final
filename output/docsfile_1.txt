5	Germany (Deutschland ), officially the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland, ), is a country in Central and Western Europe, lying between the Baltic and North Seas to the north, and the Alps to the south.
6	It borders Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, France to the southwest, and Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands to the west.
7	Germany includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate.
8	With 83 million inhabitants, it is the second most populous state of Europe after Russia, the most populous state lying entirely in Europe, as well as the most populous member state of the European Union.
9	Germany is a very decentralized country.
10	Its capital and largest metropolis is Berlin, while Frankfurt serves as its financial capital and has the country's busiest airport.
11	Germany's largest urban area is the Ruhr, with its main centres of Dortmund and Essen.
12	The country's other major cities are Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Stuttgart, Düsseldorf, Leipzig, Dresden, Bremen, Hannover, and Nuremberg.
13	Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity.
14	A region named Germania was documented before 100 AD.
15	During the Migration Period, the Germanic tribes expanded southward.
16	Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire.
17	During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation.
18	After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the German Confederation was formed in 1815.
19	The German revolutions of 1848–49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights.
20	In 1871, Germany became a nation state when most of the German states (most notably excluding Switzerland and Austria) unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire.
21	After World War I and the revolution of 1918–19, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic.
22	The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a dictatorship, the annexation of Austria, World War II, and the Holocaust.
23	After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, Austria was re-established as an independent country and two new German states were founded: West Germany, formed from the American, British, and French occupation zones, and East Germany, formed from the Soviet occupation zone.
24	Following the Revolutions of 1989 that ended communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, the country was reunified on 3 October 1990.
25	Today, the sovereign state of Germany is a federal parliamentary republic led by a chancellor.
26	It is a great power with a strong economy; it has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the fifth-largest by PPP.
27	As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer of goods.
28	A developed country with a very high standard of living, it upholds a social security and universal health care system, environmental protection, and a tuition-free university education.
29	The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1957 and the European Union in 1993.
30	It is part of the Schengen Area and became a co-founder of the Eurozone in 1999.
31	Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the G20, and the OECD.
32	Known for its rich cultural history, Germany has been continuously the home of influential and successful artists, philosophers, musicians, film people, sportspeople, entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers, and inventors.
33	Germany has a large number of World Heritage sites and is among the top tourism destinations in the world.
34	EtymologyThe English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania, which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine.
35	The German term Deutschland, originally diutisciu land (\"the German lands\") is derived from  (compare Dutch), descended from Old High German diutisc \"popular\" (i.e. belonging to the diot or diota \"people\"), originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants.
36	This in turn descends from Proto-Germanic þiudiskaz \"popular\" (see also the Latinised form Theodiscus), derived from þeudō, descended from Proto-Indo-European * \"people\", from which the word Teutons also originates.
37	HistoryThe Nebra sky disk, c. 1700 BC The discovery of the Mauer 1 mandible shows that ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago.
38	The oldest complete hunting weapons found anywhere in the world were discovered in a coal mine in Schöningen where three 380,000-year-old wooden javelins were unearthed.
39	The Neander Valley was the location where the first ever non-modern human fossil was discovered; the new species of human was called the Neanderthal.
40	The Neanderthal 1 fossils are known to be 40,000 years old.
41	Evidence of modern humans, similarly dated, has been found in caves in the Swabian Jura near Ulm.
42	The finds included 42,000-year-old bird bone and mammoth ivory flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found, the 40,000-year-old Ice Age Lion Man which is the oldest uncontested figurative art ever discovered, and the 35,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels which is the oldest uncontested human figurative art ever discovered.
43	The Nebra sky disk is a bronze artefact created during the European Bronze Age attributed to a site near Nebra, Saxony-Anhalt.
44	It is part of UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme.
45	Germanic tribes and Frankish EmpireMigrations in Europe (100–500 AD) The Germanic tribes are thought to date from the Nordic Bronze Age or the Pre-Roman Iron Age.
46	From southern Scandinavia and north Germany, they expanded south, east and west from the 1st century BC, coming into contact with the Celtic tribes of Gaul as well as Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes in Central and Eastern Europe.
47	Under Augustus, Rome began to invade Germania (an area extending roughly from the Rhine to the Ural Mountains).
48	In 9 AD, three Roman legions led by Varus were defeated by the Cheruscan leader Arminius.
49	By 100 AD, when Tacitus wrote Germania, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of the area of modern Germany.
50	However, Austria, Baden Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hessen and the western Rhineland had been conquered and incorporated into Roman provinces: Noricum, Raetia, Germania Superior, and Germania Inferior.
51	Frankish Realm and its expansion.
52	As it was partitioned in 843, West Francia (blue) and East Francia (red) became predecessors of France and Germany, respectively In the 3rd century a number of large West Germanic tribes emerged: Alemanni, Franks, Chatti, Saxons, Frisii, Sicambri, and Thuringii.
53	Around 260, the Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.
54	After the invasion of the Huns in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest.
55	Simultaneously several large tribes formed in what is now Germany and displaced or absorbed smaller Germanic tribes.
56	Large areas known since the Merovingian period as Austrasia, Neustria, and Aquitaine were conquered by the Franks who established the Frankish Kingdom, and pushed farther east to subjugate Saxony and Bavaria.
57	Areas of what is today the eastern part of Germany were inhabited by Western Slavic tribes of Sorbs, Veleti and the Obotritic confederation.
58	East Francia and Holy Roman EmpireIn 800, the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor and founded the Carolingian Empire, which was later divided in 843 among his heirs.
59	Following the break up of the Frankish Realm, for 900 years, the history of Germany was intertwined with the history of the Holy Roman Empire, which subsequently emerged from the eastern portion of Charlemagne's original empire.
60	The territory initially known as East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe River in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.
61	The Ottonian rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major duchies and the German king Otto I was crowned Holy Roman Emperor of these regions in 962.
62	In 996 Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor.
63	The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the reign of the Salian emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture Controversy.
64	Martin Luther (1483–1546) initiated the Protestant Reformation.
65	In the 12th century, under the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138–1254), German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by Slavs; they encouraged German settlement in these areas, called the eastern settlement movement (Ostsiedlung).
66	Members of the Hanseatic League, which included mostly north German cities and towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.
67	In the south, the Greater Ravensburg Trade Corporation (Große Ravensburger Handelsgesellschaft) served a similar function.
68	The edict of the Golden Bull issued in 1356 by Emperor Charles IV provided the basic constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics.
69	Population declined in the first half of the 14th century, starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348–50.
70	Despite the decline, however, German artists, engineers, and scientists developed a wide array of techniques similar to those used by the Italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant city-states as Venice, Florence and Genoa.
71	Artistic and cultural centres throughout the German states produced such artists as the Augsburg painters Hans Holbein and his son, and Albrecht Dürer.
72	Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, a development that laid the basis for the spread of learning to the masses.
73	The Holy Roman Empire in 1648, after the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War In 1517, the Wittenberg monk Martin Luther publicised The Ninety-Five Theses, challenging the Roman Catholic Church and initiating the Protestant Reformation.
74	In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg established Lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to Catholicism, but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects, a principle called Cuius regio, eius religio.
75	The agreement at Augsburg failed to address other religious creed: for example, the Reformed faith was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler, such as happened in Electorate of Cologne in 1583.
76	From the Cologne War until the end of the Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands.
77	The latter reduced the overall population of the German states by about 30 per cent, and in some places, up to 80 per cent.
78	The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the Imperial Estates of the Holy Roman Empire.
79	Their mostly German-speaking rulers were able to choose either Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, or the Reformed faith as their official religion after 1648.
80	In the 18th century, the Holy Roman Empire consisted of approximately 1,800 territories.
81	The elaborate legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1450–1555) created the Imperial Estates and provided for considerable local autonomy among ecclesiastical, secular, and hereditary states, reflected in the Imperial Diet.
82	The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740.
83	Having no male heirs, he had convinced the Electors to retain Habsburg hegemony in the office of the emperor by agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713.
84	This was finally settled through the War of Austrian Succession; in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Charles VI's daughter Maria Theresa ruled the Empire as Empress Consort when her husband, Francis I, became Holy Roman Emperor.
85	From 1740, the dualism between the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated the German history.
86	In 1772, then again in 1793 and 1795, the two dominant German states of Prussia and Austria, along with the Russian Empire, agreed to the Partitions of Poland; dividing among themselves the lands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
87	As a result of the partitions, millions of Polish speaking inhabitants fell under the rule of the two German monarchies.
88	However, the annexed territories though incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Realm, were not legally considered as a part of the Holy Roman Empire.
89	During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, along with the arrival of the Napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet, most of the secular Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed.
90	In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved; many German states, particularly the Rhineland states, fell under the influence of France.
91	Until 1815, France, Russia, Prussia and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars.
92	German Confederation and EmpireA map showing the German Confederation (1815–1836) with its 39 member states.
93	Following the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna (convened in 1814) founded the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund), a loose league of 39 sovereign states.
94	The appointment of the Emperor of Austria as the permanent president of the Confederation reflected the Congress's failure to accept Prussia's rising influence among the German states, and acerbated the long-standing competition between the Hohenzollern and Habsburg interests.
95	Disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Metternich.
96	The Zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity in the German states.
97	National and liberal ideals of the French Revolution gained increasing support among many, especially young, Germans.
98	The Hambach Festival in May 1832 was a main event in support of German unity, freedom and democracy.
99	In the light of a series of revolutionary movements in Europe, which established a republic in France, intellectuals and commoners started the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.
100	King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement.
101	Foundation of the German Empire in Versailles, 1871.
102	Bismarck is at the centre in a white uniform.
103	King William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as the new Minister President of Prussia in 1862.
104	Bismarck successfully concluded war on Denmark in 1864, which promoted German over Danish interests in the Jutland peninsula.
105	The subsequent (and decisive) Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation (Norddeutscher Bund) which excluded Austria from the federation's affairs.
106	After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871 at Versailles, uniting all the scattered parts of Germany except Austria and the German-speaking parts of Switzerland.
107	Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the Hohenzollern King of Prussia ruled as its concurrent Emperor, and Berlin became its capital.
108	In the Gründerzeit period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as Chancellor of Germany under Emperor William I secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances, isolating France by diplomatic means, and avoiding war.
109	Under Wilhelm II, Germany, like other European powers, took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries.
110	Most alliances in which Germany had previously been involved were not renewed.
111	This resulted in the creation of a dual alliance with the multinational realm of Austria-Hungary, promoting at least benevolent neutrality if not outright military support.
112	Subsequently, the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy, completing a Central European geographic alliance that illustrated German, Austrian and Italian fears of incursions against them by France and/or Russia.
113	Similarly, Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances that would protect them against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.
114	The German Empire (1871–1918), with the Kingdom of Prussia in blue At the Berlin Conference in 1884, Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa, German South West Africa, Togoland, and Kamerun.
115	Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include German New Guinea, German Micronesia and German Samoa in the Pacific, and Kiautschou Bay in China.
116	In what became known as the \"First Genocide of the Twentieth-Century\", between 1904 and 1907, the German colonial government in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) ordered the annihilation of the local Herero and Namaqua peoples, as a punitive measure for an uprising against German colonial rule.
117	In total, around 100,000 people—80% of the Herero and 50% of the Namaqua—perished from imprisonment in concentration camps, where the majority died of disease, abuse, and exhaustion, or from dehydration and starvation in the countryside after being deprived of food and water.
118	The assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for the Austrian Empire to attack Serbia and trigger World War I. After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed, a general armistice ended the fighting on 11 November, and German troops returned home.
119	In the German Revolution (November 1918), Emperor Wilhelm II and all German ruling princes abdicated their positions and responsibilities.
120	Germany's new political leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.
121	In this treaty, Germany, as part of the Central Powers, accepted defeat by the Allies in one of the bloodiest conflicts of all time.
122	Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating and unjust and it was later seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler.
123	After the defeat in the First World War, Germany lost around 13% of its European territory (areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic Polish, French and Danish populations, which were lost following the Greater Poland Uprising, the return of Alsace-Lorraine and the Schleswig plebiscites), and all of its colonial possessions in Africa and the South Sea.
124	Weimar Republic and Nazi GermanyPhilipp Scheidemann proclaims the German Republic from the Reichskanzlei window, on 9 November 1918.
125	Germany was declared a federal republic at the beginning of the German Revolution in November 1918, with 18 substates in 1925.
126	On 11 August 1919 President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution.
127	In the subsequent struggle for power, the radical-left Communists seized power in Bavaria, but conservative elements in other parts of Germany attempted to overthrow the Republic in the Kapp Putsch.
128	It was supported by parts of the Reichswehr (military) and other conservative, nationalistic and monarchist factions.
129	After a tumultuous period of bloody street fighting in the major industrial centres, the occupation of the Ruhr by Belgian and French troops and the rise of inflation culminating in the hyperinflation of 1922–23, a debt restructuring plan and the creation of a new currency in 1924 ushered in the Golden Twenties, an era of increasing artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.
130	Historians describe the period between 1924 and 1929 as one of \"partial stabilisation.\"
131	The worldwide Great Depression hit Germany in 1929.
132	After the federal election of 1930, Chancellor Heinrich Brüning's government was enabled by President Paul von Hindenburg to act without parliamentary approval.
133	Brüning's government pursued a policy of fiscal austerity and deflation which caused high unemployment of nearly 30% by 1932.
134	The Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler won the special federal election of 1932.
135	After a series of unsuccessful cabinets, Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933.
136	After the Reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic civil rights and within weeks the first Nazi concentration camp at Dachau opened.
137	The Enabling Act of 1933 gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power; subsequently, his government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the League of Nations following a national referendum, and began military rearmament.
138	Adolf Hitler, leader of Nazi Germany (1933–1945) Using deficit spending, a government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works projects.
139	In public work projects of 1934, 1.7 million Germans immediately were put to work, which gave them an income and social benefits.
140	The most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway, the Reichsautobahn, known as the German autobahns.
141	Other capital construction projects included hydroelectric facilities such as the Rur Dam, water supplies such as Zillierbach Dam, and transportation hubs such as Zwickau Hauptbahnhof.
142	Over the next five years, unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose.
143	In 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities.
144	Germany also reacquired control of the Saar in 1935, remilitarised the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement and in direct violation of the agreement occupied Czechoslovakia with the proclamation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in March 1939.
145	Kristallnacht, or the \"Night of Broken Glass\", saw the burning of hundreds of synagogues, the destruction of thousands of Jewish businesses, and the arrest of around 30,000 Jewish men by Nazi forces inside Germany.
146	Many Jewish women were arrested and placed in jails and a curfew was placed on the Jewish people in Germany.
147	In August 1939, Hitler's government negotiated and signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.
148	Following the agreement, on 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, marking the beginning of World War II in Europe.
149	WWII, German-occupied Europe in 1942 In response to Hitler's actions, two days later, on 3 September, after a British ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany.
150	In the spring of 1940, Germany conquered Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France forcing the French government to sign an armistice after German troops occupied most of the country.
151	The British repelled German air attacks in the Battle of Britain in the same year.
152	In 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union.
153	By 1942, Germany and other Axis powers controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa, but following the Soviet Union's victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, the allies' reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats.
154	In June 1944, the Western allies landed in France and the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe.
155	By late 1944, the Western allies had entered Germany despite one final German counter offensive in the Ardennes Forest.
156	Following Hitler's suicide during the Battle of Berlin, German armed forces surrendered on 8 May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.
157	After World War II, former members of the Nazi regime were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.
158	In what later became known as The Holocaust, the German government persecuted minorities and used a network of concentration and death camps across Europe to conduct a genocide of what they considered to be inferior peoples.
159	In total, over 10 million civilians were systematically murdered, including 6 million Jews, between 220,000 and 1,500,000 Romani, 275,000 persons with disabilities, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, thousands of homosexuals, and hundreds of thousands of members of the political and religious opposition from Germany, and occupied countries (Nacht und Nebel).
160	Nazi policies in the German occupied countries resulted in the deaths of 2.7 million Poles, 1.3 million Ukrainians, 1 million Belarusians and an estimated 2.8 million Soviet war prisoners.
161	In addition, the Nazi regime abducted approximately 12 million people from across the German occupied Europe for use as slave labour in the German industry.
162	German military war casualties have been estimated at 5.3 million, and around 900,000 German civilians died; 400,000 from Allied bombing, and 500,000 in the course of the Soviet invasion from the east.
163	Around 12 million ethnic Germans were expelled from across Eastern Europe.
164	Germany lost roughly one-quarter of its pre-war territory.
165	Strategic bombing and land warfare destroyed many cities and cultural heritage sites.
166	East and West GermanyAmerican, Soviet, British and French occupation zones in Germany, and the French controlled Saar Protectorate, 1947.
167	Territories east of the Oder-Neisse line transferred to Poland and the Soviet Union under the terms of the Potsdam Conference.
168	After Nazi Germany surrendered, the Allies partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four military occupation zones.
169	The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik).
170	They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany.
171	East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo.
172	West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a \"social market economy\".
173	Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the Marshall Plan and used this to rebuild its industry.
174	Konrad Adenauer was elected the first Federal Chancellor (Bundeskanzler) of Germany in 1949 and remained in office until 1963.
175	Under his and Ludwig Erhard's leadership, the country enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s, that became known as an \"economic miracle\" (Wirtschaftswunder).
176	The Federal Republic of Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1957.
177	The Berlin Wall during its fall in 1989, with the Brandenburg Gate in the background.
178	East Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the USSR via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact.
179	Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (Politbüro) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany, supported by the Stasi, an immense secret service controlling many aspects of the society.
180	A Soviet-style command economy was set up and the GDR later became a Comecon state.
181	While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.
182	The Berlin Wall, rapidly built on 13 August 1961 prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, eventually becoming a symbol of the Cold War.
183	Ronald Reagan's \"Mr. Gorbachov, Tear down this wall!\" speech at the Wall on 12 June 1987 influenced public opinion, echoing John F. Kennedy's famous Ich bin ein Berliner speech of 26 June 1963.
184	The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism, the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, German Reunification and Die Wende.
185	Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the early 1970s by Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik.
186	In summer 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open the borders, causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary.
187	This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support.
188	The East German authorities eased the border restrictions, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West; originally intended to help retain East Germany as a state, the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process.
189	This culminated in the Two Plus Four Treaty a year later on 12 September 1990, under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the Instrument of Surrender, and Germany regained full sovereignty.
190	This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR.
191	Reunified Germany and the European UnionGerman unity was established on 3 October 1990.
192	Since 1999, the Reichstag building in Berlin has been the meeting place of the Bundestag, the German parliament.
193	The united Germany is considered to be the enlarged continuation of the Federal Republic of Germany and not a successor state.
194	As such, it retained all of West Germany's memberships in international organisations.
195	Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act, adopted in 1994, Berlin once again became the capital of the reunified Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city) retaining some federal ministries.
196	The relocation of the government was completed in 1999.
197	Following the 1998 elections, SPD politician Gerhard Schröder became the first Chancellor of a red–green coalition with the Alliance '90/The Greens party.
198	Among the major projects of the two Schröder legislatures was the Agenda 2010 to reform the labour market to become more flexible and reduce unemployment.
199	The modernisation and integration of the eastern German economy is a long-term process scheduled to last until the year 2019, with annual transfers from west to east amounting to roughly $80 billion.
200	Germany became a co-founder of the European Union (1993), introduced the Euro currency (2002), and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007 (pictured).

254	The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law).
255	Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law are valid in perpetuity.
256	The president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier (19 March 2017–present), is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers.
257	He is elected by the Bundesversammlung (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates.
258	The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the Bundestagspräsident (President of the Bundestag), who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.
259	The third-highest official and the head of government is the Chancellor, who is appointed by the Bundespräsident after being elected by the Bundestag.

420	In 2015, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 12 million of all 244 million migrants.
421	Germany ranks 7th amongst EU countries and 37th globally in terms of the percentage of migrants who made up part of the country's population.
422	, the largest national group was from Turkey (2,859,000), followed by Poland (1,617,000), Russia (1,188,000), and Italy (764,000).

424	Since 1987, around 3 million ethnic Germans, mostly from the former Eastern Bloc countries, have exercised their right of return and emigrated to Germany.
425	ReligionUpon its establishment in 1871, Germany was about two-thirds Protestant and one-third Roman Catholic, with a notable Jewish minority.
426	Other faiths existed in the state, but never achieved a demographic significance and cultural impact of these three confessions.
427	Germany lost nearly all of its Jewish minority during the Holocaust.
428	Religious makeup changed gradually in the decades following 1945, with West Germany becoming more religiously diversified through immigration and East Germany becoming overwhelmingly irreligious through state policies.
429	It continues to diversify after the German reunification in 1990, with an accompanying substantial decline in religiosity throughout all of Germany and a contrasting increase of evangelical Protestants and Muslims.
430	Geographically, Protestantism is concentrated in the northern, central and eastern parts of the country.

441	An 2017 estimate even shows that 37,0 % of the German population were nonconfessional.
442	Islam is the second largest religion in the country.
443	In the 2011 census, 1.9% of the census population (1.52 million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is deemed unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this religion (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question.
444	Figures from Religionswissenschaftlicher Medien- und Informationsdienst suggest a figure of 4.4 to 4.7 million (around 5.5% of the population) in 2015.
445	A study conducted by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees found that between 2011 and 2015 the Muslim population rose by 1.2 million people, mostly due to immigration.

634	He has been the band's only constant member since their inception in 1975 and, along with guitarist Dave Murray, one of only two members to have appeared on all of their albums.
635	Harris has a recognisable and popular style of bass playing, particularly the \"gallop\" which can be found on several Iron Maiden recordings, such as the singles \"Run to the Hills\" and \"The Trooper\".
636	In addition to his role as the band's bass player, writer and backing vocalist, he has undertaken many other roles for the group, such as producing and co-producing their albums, directing and editing their live videos and performing studio keyboards and synthesizers.
637	He has been cited as one of the greatest heavy metal bassists.
638	On 24 September 2012, Harris released his debut solo album, British Lion.
639	Early lifeHarris was born and grew up in Leytonstone, where he grew up aspiring to be a professional footballer.
640	Scouted by Wally St Pier, Harris was asked to train for West Ham United.
641	After gaining an interest in rock music in his early teens, he realised that he no longer desired to play football professionally.
642	Initially Harris wanted to play drums, but did not have enough space for a drum kit in his house and so decided on the bass instead.
643	Entirely self-taught, his first bass was a copy of a Fender Precision model which cost him £40 in 1971.
644	Just 10 months after he bought his first bass, Harris joined a band, initially known as Influence and later Gypsy's Kiss, featuring Bob Verscoyle (lead vocals), Dave Smith (guitar) and drummer Paul Sears.
645	After a short number of gigs at the Cart and Horses pub in Maryland Point, Stratford and the Bridgehouse in Canning Town, the band split up and Harris auditioned for a band called Smiler in February 1974.
646	In this outfit, Harris began writing his own songs and worked with future Iron Maiden members Dennis Wilcock and Doug Sampson, but left the band after they refused to play his material, claiming it was too complicated.
647	CareerIron MaidenUpon leaving Smiler, Harris went on to create Iron Maiden on Christmas Day 1975, with the band's name being inspired by the film The Man in the Iron Mask.
648	Before Iron Maiden signed their contract with EMI in 1979, Harris worked as an architectural draughtsman in the East End of London (he had studied architectural drawing at Leyton Sixth Form College) until he was made redundant, at which point he undertook a job as a street sweeper.
649	Since their inception, Harris has been the band's principal composer and lyricist.
650	His song writing typically showcases his trademark galloping bass patterns, which features heavily in songs such as \"The Trooper\" and \"Run to the Hills\", and his progressive rock-influenced time changes.
651	Recently, Harris' songs have become more progressive, and guitarist Adrian Smith has commented that Harris now prefers contributing \"lyrics and melodies and arranging\" to other member's songs over writing alone.
652	Harris frequently writes lyrics about mythology, history or topics inspired from books and films, reflecting his interests and progressive rock influences.
653	Solo projectIn September 2012, Harris released his first solo album, British Lion.
654	Originating with a band, named British Lion, which he managed and wrote with in the early 1990s, Harris kept in touch with its vocalist, Richard Taylor, and guitarist, Graham Leslie, and the album, consisting of 1970s influenced hard rock songs, was written and recorded over a number of years around Iron Maiden's tour schedule.
655	Speaking to Kerrang!
656	in September 2012, Harris stated that he considers the record to be \"more of a side-project\" than a solo album, as he is more \"comfortable in a band environment.
657	\"In an interview with Classic Rock in August, Harris stated that he will be releasing more solo albums and hopes to tour with the band in the future.
658	Harris has taken the outfit on two separate European club tours in 2013 and 2014, with an additional tour taking place in 2016.
659	On 2 September 2016, Harris announced that he intends to issue a live album recorded at shows from across the three tours.
660	Personal lifeHarris at West Ham United's Boleyn Ground during Soccer Six 2005.
661	Harris' eldest daughter, Lauren, is a singer and supported Iron Maiden with her solo outfit in 2006 and 2008.
662	In 2008, she released a solo album, entitled Calm Before the Storm, and is currently a member of a band called Kingdom of I after forming Six Hour Sundown.
663	In addition, Harris' oldest son, George, plays guitar in a band, the Raven Age, who were the opening act on Iron Maiden's The Book Of Souls World Tour in 2016.
664	His second-oldest daughter, Kerry, works as a Production Assistant for Iron Maiden while his third-oldest daughter, Faye, is a fashion writer for HuffPost.
665	In 1993, Harris was divorced from his wife, Lorraine, whom he met 16 years previously.
666	He later said this was \"probably the toughest time I've ever faced,\" and the changes in his personal life are credited with inspiring the mood of the following Iron Maiden album, 1995's The X Factor.
667	Harris has four children with Lorraine: Lauren, Kerry, Faye and George, and two children with current partner Emma: Stanley and Maisie.
668	Since the 1980s, Harris has owned a Grade II listed building in Sheering Essex, in the grounds of which he built his own recording and editing studio, \"Barnyard\".
669	In November 2012, the nine-acre property was put on sale, with a spokesman for his estate agent, Hamptons International, stating that \"he now lives between Los Angeles and the Bahamas\".
670	A keen footballer, Harris played for amateur clubs as a child and was later scouted by Wally St Pier and asked to train for West Ham United, of whom he has been a fan since he was 9 years old.
671	Although he had aspired to play professionally up to that point, Harris would eventually realise that \"it wasn't really what [he] wanted to do.\"
672	Nevertheless, Harris still plays football regularly with his own team, \"Maidonians\", and still supports West Ham, staying in contact with the club, and having their crest on his most-used Precision Bass.
673	Musical styleTechniqueHarris is often considered among the best and most influential heavy metal bassists.
674	He is most known for his \"galloping\" playing style: usually an eighth note followed by two sixteenth notes at fast tempo (e.g., \"The Trooper\" and \"Run to the Hills\") or eighth note triplets, which he plays with two fingers, rather than using a plectrum.
675	Before playing, Harris often chalks his fingers, to make these fast patterns easier to play, as shown on the bonus DVD for the A Matter of Life and Death album.
676	Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers has commented that \"Steve taught himself in a way that nobody can really copy it.
677	People say it's like a lead guitar, but it's not.
678	It gives the band a basis and it moves around quite a lot, but it's the tone that he has.
679	Steve has a way of hearing things and a tone that isn't normally associated with a bass, it's more like a rhythm guitar.\"
680	InfluencesHarris was influenced by the progressive rock bands of the 1970s, as well as early hard rock and heavy metal bands.
681	His influences include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Thin Lizzy, UFO, Uriah Heep, Wishbone Ash, and Yes.
682	Speaking about the early Iron Maiden sound, Steve Harris described the band as using twin-guitar harmonies inspired by Wishbone Ash and Thin Lizzy, complex time and mood changes from Genesis and Jethro Tull, and the dark melodic elements of Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and Led Zeppelin.
683	EquipmentHarris mainly plays a specially-painted Fender Precision Bass, featured on every Iron Maiden album, which has gone through a total of four colour changes since he began using it.
684	Originally white, it was then changed to black prior to the band's first album, followed by blue sparkle and finally white with claret and blue pinstriping with the West Ham United F.C. crest.
685	Harris has had his bass modified to include a mirrored scratchplate, Badass bridges and Seymour Duncan custom SPB-1 pickups and uses his own signature set of RotoSound flatwound strings.
686	In 2009, Fender issued a signature Steve Harris Precision bass, featuring an alder body, a blue-sparkle finish, mirrored scratchplate, Seymour Duncan SPB-1 pickups and a Badass II bridge.
687	In 2015, Fender released a revised model of the signature bass, which now features a maple body, a white finish with blue pinstripes and the West Ham crest, a Fender High Mass bridge and a Seymour Duncan SPB-4 Steve Harris signature pickup, with the pickup also being sold separately.
688	In 2005, Metal Hammer reported that he uses eight 4x12\" Marshall cabinets with Trace Elliot amplifiers.
689	He also uses four Sony WRT 27 wireless transmitters, allowing him to be as mobile as possible on stage.
690	A diagram of Harris' 2000 bass rig is documented on GuitarGeek.com.
691	Other interests and talents
692	In addition to playing bass and writing music/lyrics for the band, Steve Harris has taken on numerous other roles, such as:music production/mixingmusic video directing/editinglive video directing/editingkeyboardsbacking vocalsstring/bass synthesizersAlthough he performed keyboards on Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, along with guitarist Adrian Smith, in 1988, Harris only began regularly contributing keyboards to Iron Maiden's studio albums from Virtual XI onwards.
693	Until Virtual XI, Michael Kenney, Harris' bass technician, had provided the keyboards from 1990's No Prayer for the Dying onwards, and still does so live and acts as a supervisor in the studio.
694	Along with Smith and guitarist Dave Murray, Harris experimented with synthesizers on the Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son albums, using bass synth on Somewhere in Time, and performing \"string synth\" keyboards on Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.
695	Steve Harris is also known for playing an increasing role in mixing the band's albums and produced most of their 1990's output, with recording taking place at a studio he owned at the time, located in a barn on his property, named \"Barnyard Studios\".
696	Since 2000's Brave New World, at Bruce Dickinson's insistence, the band did not record again at Barnyard, which Dickinson claims had limitations due to its size, and hired Kevin Shirley, with whom Harris co-produces.
697	Harris also directs and edits many of the band's live videos, beginning with Maiden England in 1989.
698	Although not intending to himself, Harris edited the Rock in Rio DVD as he was unsatisfied with the results produced by the band's hired production crew.
699	In undertaking the project, Harris had to teach himself how to use digital editing software with equipment he had installed in Barnyard Studios, and went on to edit Iron Maiden's next DVD, Death on the Road.
700	On top of this, he has contributed to the production of thirteen of the band's music videos, with \"Infinite Dreams\", \"Holy Smoke\", \"Tailgunner\" and \"Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter\" being directed and edited by Harris alone.

718	Generally, power metal is characterized by a faster, lighter, and more uplifting sound, in contrast with the heaviness and dissonance prevalent for example in extreme metal.
719	Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \"powerful\" sound.
720	The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.
721	OriginsAnthropologist Sam Dunn traced the origins of power metal back to the late 1970s, when the groundwork for power metal lyrical style was laid down by Ronnie James Dio.
722	The fantasy-oriented lyrics he wrote for Rainbow, concentrated around medieval, renaissance, folk, and science fiction themes, directly influenced modern power metal bands.
723	It is mentioned that songs \"Stargazer\" and \"A Light in the Black\", from the 1976 album Rising and 1978's Long Live Rock 'n' Roll, \"Kill the King\" and \"Lady of the Lake\", respectively, might be among the earliest examples of power metal.
724	In his 2011 documentary series Metal Evolution, Dunn further explained how Rob Halford of Judas Priest created a blueprint for power metal vocal delivery.
725	His almost constant high-pitched singing became one of the main characteristics of power metal.
726	The twin-guitar sound promoted by duo of K. K. Downing and Glenn Tipton highly influenced this subgenre.
727	Another pioneer in the power metal genre is Jon Mikl Thor, who was a strong inspiration to the American band Manowar.
728	Another British band, Iron Maiden, brought epic and melodic sensibility to metal, creating anthemic, singalong music, an approach widely embraced by modern power metal musicians.
729	The emergence of the early German power metal scene in particular was made possible by Scorpions and Accept.
730	Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen made a significant impact on many future power metal guitarists, with his accurate and fast neo-classical style.
731	His bandmate Jens Johansson modernized the keyboard sound of Deep Purple's Jon Lord, which was further incorporated into the genre.
732	Manowar's mythological sword and sorcery lyrics influenced a number of power metal bands.
733	In 1987 Helloween released their second album, Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I, cited by Allmusic as \"a landmark recording that remains arguably the single most influential power metal album to date.
734	Its volatile combination of power and melody would inspire an entire generation of metal bands\".
735	Musical characteristicsKai Hansen of Gamma Ray, ex-Helloween during a show in Barcelona, Spain.
736	Hansen is widely regarded as the \"godfather of power metal\".
737	Power metal is today associated with fast tempo and melodic harmonies, the sound tempered by characteristics of speed metal, power metal's musical forerunner.
738	VocalsPower metal is highly focused on the vocalist, with \"clean\" vocals being much more prevalent than the growling vocals often associated with extreme metal.
739	Inspired by Ronnie James Dio, Bruce Dickinson, Rob Halford, Geoff Tate and other heavy metal vocalists, power metal vocals are often in a high register, and the singer's vocal range is usually wide.
740	The majority of the genre's vocalists sing in the tenor range and are capable of hitting very high notes, for example Timo Kotipelto of Stratovarius, Tony Kakko of Sonata Arctica,  Michael Kiske (ex-Helloween) and Andre Matos (ex-Angra).
741	There are many exceptions who sing in either baritone or bass range.
742	Some vocalists sing in a harsh, thrash metal style, including Chris Boltendahl of Grave Digger, Kai Hansen of Gamma Ray and Peavy Wagner of Rage, or even make use of growls, like Alexi Laiho of Children of Bodom and Wintersun's Jari Mäenpää.
743	Many power metal vocalists, most notably Hansi Kürsch of Blind Guardian, record multi-layered vocals reminiscent of Queen creating a choral effect.
744	Lyrical themesPower metal's lyrical themes often focus on fantasy and mythology, camaraderie and hope, personal struggles and emotions, war and death, or combinations of the listed themes.
745	For example, Finnish band Sonata Arctica have been known for focusing their lyrics of their songs on fantasy but also have many songs based on reality, love and relationships.
746	Many Power metal bands based their concept albums on fantasy books and national epics; for example Blind Guardian based their Nightfall in Middle-Earth on The Silmarillion by Tolkien and Kamelot based Epica and The Black Halo on Goethe's Faust.
747	Some bands have even written their own imaginary stories, like Rhapsody of Fire's Emerald Sword Saga and The Dark Secret Saga, Iced Earth's Something Wicked Saga or Avantasia by Edguy's Tobias Sammet.
748	Many otherwise typical metal themes such as religion and politics are comparatively rare but not unheard of.
749	Historical themes have also been used.
750	Sabaton's main lyrical themes focus on historical wars, war battles and individuals of war who are and have been notably recognized in war.
751	Examples include World War I, World War II, Vikings, Samurai, and much more from around the world including the American, Swedish and German militaries.
752	Serenity, an Austrian (symphonic) power metal band, focuses mainly on historical figures and events, including Sir Francis Drake, Marco Polo, Galileo, Beethoven, and Napoleon.
753	InstrumentationPower metal guitarists and bassists generally play rapid streams of notes, but change chords comparatively slowly, with a harmonic tempo of once per measure or slower.
754	Fast and technically demanding guitar solos, however, are almost guaranteed.
755	The slow changing of chords is significant in defining power metal just as the fast rapid chord changes often define traditional thrash metal.
756	Power metal often makes use of Major chord progressions as well as circle progressions.
757	Some of the most influential and acclaimed power metal guitarists are Kai Hansen of Gamma Ray, Michael Weikath of Helloween, and Timo Tolkki formerly of Stratovarius.
758	It is a common trait in power metal for the bass guitar to take a back seat, so to speak; often simply providing the chord root notes and being drowned out by the more prevalent rhythm guitars.
759	However, some power metal bands incorporate bass that is more audible with colorful patterns distinct from the rhythm guitars, such as Helloween, Hibria, and Symphony X.Many power metal drummers play double bass patterns with either two bass drums, or utilize a double bass pedal; using them to play a constant stream of sixteenth notes (semiquavers) with snare drum accents on the beat, a style not restricted to, but most often associated with, power metal.
760	The style was used by drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg of Helloween, setting a blueprint for many other drummers to follow.
761	Others, such as the drummers of Blind Guardian and Iced Earth, use a more thrash metal style of drumming with rapid bursts of double bass that involve three to six beats with the double kick.
762	Power metal bands often incorporate keyboards into their musical arrangements, something popularized by Jens Johansson of Stratovarius, though their usage varies from subtle accents to a full-blown melody line.
763	Some power metal bands also record with symphonic elements, and as such, they utilize a full orchestra to fill the role usually played by the keyboardist.
764	StylesAmerican styleThis branch of power metal emerged in early 1980s in the United States, drawing its influences mainly from traditional metal and the NWOBHM.
765	Though very close to its roots, US power metal (often abbreviated USPM) is often faster and more energetic than traditional heavy metal, with a more riff-driven approach than its later European counterpart and with a relative lack of keyboards, but more melodic and often with a higher emphasis on guitar leads than thrash metal.
766	USPM is also notable for its wide (but not universal) use of high-register operatic vocals, a trend which would continue with the rise of European power metal in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
767	This style is not exclusive to North America, as European bands such as Sacred Steel, Majesty, and Australian band Pegazus later adopted a style inspired by USPM bands in the 1990s.
768	The early releases of progressive metal bands Queensrÿche and Fates Warning, such as The Warning (1984) and The Spectre Within (1985), heavily influenced a number of bands that were to develop a common sound towards the late 1980s.
769	Among the better known representatives of the style, such as Manowar, Vicious Rumors, Virgin Steele, Riot or Jag Panzer, a small number of bands enriched their sound with progressive and epic elements; the most obvious examples being Crimson Glory, Savatage, Sanctuary and the epic doom metal band Cirith Ungol.
770	US power metal saw a sharp decline in popularity at the beginning of the 1990s, though the style has rebounded somewhat in the past decade, with bands such as Liege Lord or Heir Apparent reforming for live performances and some, like Helstar, Artizan, Omen and Manilla Road, releasing new material.
771	European styleItalian band Rhapsody of Fire performing in Buenos Aires in 2010.
772	European power metal originated from speed metal and the NWOBHM, emerging in late 1980s, particularly in Germany, with Helloween, Running Wild, Rage, Grave Digger and Blind Guardian, followed by Finland's Stratovarius in late 1980s and the early 1990s.
773	These bands pioneered the genre, but took it in somewhat different directions.
774	Helloween, followed by early Gamma Ray, mixed fast palm muted speed metal riffs with high-pitched clean vocals, and with a strong focus on melody and uplifting, positive themes.
775	Stratovarius further developed this melodic direction by making heavy use of keyboards, with lyrics dealing with emotions and personal issues.
776	Blind Guardian utilized the technique of vocal and guitar overdubbing to create an epic atmosphere, with lyrical content strongly based on fantasy novels, myths and legends.
777	The symphonic and neo-classical elements also found their way through power metal with bands like Rhapsody of Fire, Serenity and Nightwish.
778	HammerFall simplified their power metal to bring it closer to traditional heavy metal.
779	This genre spread over Europe, often incorporating further influences from progressive and folk music.
780	Italy's Elvenking, Sweden's Falconer and Denmark's Wuthering Heights are in particular influenced by folk music, while Angra, Kamelot, and especially Symphony X (though none of these 3 are European) are known for combining progressive and power metal.
781	Furthermore, some bands are known for combining power metal with more aggressive musical forms, such as Children of Bodom, who combined elements of power and melodic death metal, or Iced Earth, who combined power and thrash metal.
782	Two Helloween albums, Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I (1987) and Part II (1988) are usually considered the first proper European power metal albums.
783	European style power metal became widespread in comparison with US style as of the mid 1990s, with numerous North American bands such as Theocracy, Borealis, Forgotten Tales, Avian, Pharaoh, Nevermore, Circle II Circle, and Kamelot demonstrating the style.
784	This European style of power metal is sometimes considered the \"second wave\" of power metal since its origination was in the late 1980s rather than the mid 1980s, and the widespread influence and development of the genre that came in its tow while US \"first wave\" style markedly declined.

788	The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and former lead singer Tarja Turunen.
789	The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, Angels Fall First (1997).
790	In 2001, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers.
791	Although Nightwish have been prominent in their home country since Angels Fall First, they did not achieve wider success until the release of the albums Oceanborn (1998), Wishmaster (2000) and Century Child (2002).
792	Their 2004 album, Once, has sold more than one million copies and was the band's breakthrough in the United States.
793	Their biggest US hit single, \"Wish I Had an Angel\" (2004), received MTV airplay and was included on three US film soundtracks to promote their North American tour.
794	The band produced three more singles and two music videos for Once, as well as a re-recording of \"Sleeping Sun\" for the compilation album, Highest Hopes: The Best of Nightwish (2005), before Turunen's dismissal in October 2005.
795	Her last performance with Nightwish was during a concert recorded for the live album/DVD End of an Era.
796	After the concert, the other members informed Turunen with an open letter that she was no longer a member of Nightwish.
797	In May 2007, Nightwish announced Anette Olzon as Turunen's replacement.
798	That September, the band released their sixth album, Dark Passion Play, which has sold almost 2 million copies.
799	The album's lead single, \"Amaranth\", became one of Nightwish's most successful in Europe.
800	The supporting tour, one of the band's largest, started on October 6, 2007 and ended on September 19, 2009.
801	The band released an EP/live album, Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places), in March 2009 as a CD/DVD, and their seventh studio album, Imaginaerum, was released globally on various days in late 2011/early 2012.
802	On October 1, 2012, Nightwish announced that they had parted ways with Olzon and would be finishing the tour with at that time ReVamp vocalist (ex-After Forever) Floor Jansen.
803	In October 2013, Nightwish made Jansen and longtime session uilleann pipes player Troy Donockley permanent members of the band, and they were featured in the acclaimed album Endless Forms Most Beautiful, released on March 27, 2015.
804	Nightwish is the third-best-selling band and musical entity in Finland with certified sales of nearly 900,000 certified copies.
805	The group is also the most successful Finnish band worldwide, selling more than 9 million records and receiving more than 60 gold and platinum awards, having released five Number 1 albums and thirteen Number 1 singles.
806	On October 26th, 2018, Nightwish has been inducted to the Finnish Music Hall of Fame, becoming the honorary gallery's 11th member.
807	HistoryFormation (1996)Tuomas Holopainen (left) and Emppu Vuorinen (right), two of the band's founding members.
808	After playing keyboards in several heavy metal bands in the 1990s, including Nattvindens Gråt and Darkwoods My Betrothed, Tuomas Holopainen decided to create his own project while sitting around a campfire with friends in 1996.
809	He immediately had a clear idea of the music: experimental acoustic music he wrote himself during his time in the Finnish Army, similar to the music usually played around campfires, but with a distinct sound and atmosphere, played on his keyboards.
810	He soon invited friend and schoolmate Erno \"Emppu\" Vuorinen to play acoustic guitars, and the classical vocalist Tarja Turunen, who shared the same music teacher, Plamen Dimov.
811	The three musicians recorded their self-titled acoustic demo in winter 1996.
812	The name \"Nightwish\" was derived from their first song together – the demo also included the song \"The Forever Moments\", and an early version of \"Etiäinen\".
813	Debut album and first tour (1997–1998)In early 1997, following the release of the Nightwish demo, Jukka \"Julius\" Nevalainen joined the band, and acoustic guitar was replaced with electric guitar.
814	The addition of heavy metal elements to the band's existing experimental style gave the band a different sound, forming the core of the Nightwish sound.
815	The band entered the studio in April 1997 to record seven songs for their second demo, Angels Fall First.
816	In May 1997, the demo made its way to the Finnish record label Spinefarm Records, who wanted to release it as the band's debut album of the same name.
817	The label offered Nightwish to a record deal, and the band returned to the studio to record four more songs to accompany the tracks of the demo.
818	The full-length album was released in November 1997 and reached number 31 on the Finnish album charts, with the single \"The Carpenter\" reaching number 3 on the Finnish singles chart.
819	\"The Carpenter\" single was released as a split with label mates Children of Bodom and Thy Serpent; the album is also one of the two releases which features Holopainen's vocals, appearing on four of the album's eleven tracks alongside Turunen's.
820	The band made their live debut in their hometown Kitee in December 1997.
821	Since they were missing a bass player, Samppa Hirvonen joined them as a sessional live member.
822	Marianna Pellinen was also a sessional live member as an additional keyboard player and a backing vocalist for Turunen.
823	There were plans to make Hirvonen a permanent member, but he joined the army as part of Finnish army conscription just as they began recording Oceanborn, so they asked Sami Vänskä to join instead, since Tuomas knew him from the band Nattvindens Gråt.
824	During the winter of 1997 and 1998, the band performed only seven times, because Turunen was finishing her schooling, and Nevalainen and Vuorinen were serving their obligatory Finnish military service.
825	Nightwish returned to the studio in August 1998 as a five-piece to record their follow-up album for Spinefarm Records.
826	International success (1998–2000)On October 7, 1998, Nightwish released their second full-length album, Oceanborn, in Finland only.
827	Adopting a more technical and progressive sound than Angels Fall First, Oceanborn saw the band abandon much of the ambient and folk elements present on their debut release, with the exception of the song \"Moondance\".
828	In contrast to the female vocals of Turunen, the album also featured guest growling vocals by Tapio Wilska (ex-Finntroll), since Tuomas did not want to sing again.
829	Wilska is also a former member of Nattvindens Gråt.
830	AllMusic review said that the album \"as a whole works great\", with songs that are \"very strong\".
831	Oceanborn was an instant success in Finland, reaching number 5 on the Finnish album charts.
832	The album's first single, \"Sacrament of Wilderness\", hit number 1 on the Finnish singles charts, where it stayed for several weeks.
833	The album's release was initially limited to Finland, but because of the success of \"Sacrament of Wilderness\", Spinefarm released Oceanborn internationally in the spring of 1999.
834	In May 1999, Nightwish recorded the single \"Sleeping Sun (Four Ballads of the Eclipse)\", and in one month the single sold 15,000 copies in Germany alone.
835	Following the band's first international success, Nightwish was added as the opening band for Rage's 1999 European tour.
836	Both the album Oceanborn and the singles \"Sacrament of Wilderness\" and \"Walking in the Air\" were certified gold in Finland in August 1999.
837	While in the studio in early 2000 working on their third album, Nightwish was accepted in the Finnish Eurovision Song Contest tryouts with the song \"Sleepwalker\".
838	Despite winning the public vote, Nightwish eventually finished in third place, with the jury choosing local gospel singer Nina Åström to represent Finland.
839	On May 19, 2000, Nightwish released their third studio album Wishmaster.
840	This debuted at No. 1 on the Finnish album charts, and was certified gold in Finland after three weeks at number one.
841	Critical response to the album was mixed, with Allmusic citing the album as repetitive, and saying \"as a whole album, it can be a little annoying, even frustrating\".
842	However, German magazine Rock Hard declared Wishmaster \"Album of the Month\", despite competing against long-awaited May releases from Iron Maiden and Bon Jovi.
843	Following the release of Wishmaster, Nightwish embarked on their first world tour, playing dates in South America, Mexico, Canada, and the first headlining European tour with Sinergy and Eternal Tears of Sorrow.
844	In the summer, the band returned to Europe, appearing at the Wacken Open Air festival and the Biebop Metal Fest.
845	New bassist and symphonic elements (2001–2003)In 2001, Nightwish recorded a cover of Gary Moore's \"Over the Hills and Far Away\" together with two new songs (\"10th Man Down\", unreleased from Oceanborn sessions, and \"Away\", unreleased from Wishmaster sessions) and a remake of \"Astral Romance\" (from the Angels Fall First album) with Tony Kakko (Sonata Arctica) singing Tuomas' part.
846	This new material was released as their first (and until 2009 the only) EP, Over the Hills and Far Away.
847	The record also included guest performances by Tapio Wilska once again on \"10th Man Down\".
848	Nightwish's version of \"Over the Hills and Far Away\" was well received by fans, becoming a frequent part of the band's live performances, but the other songs never had a great break-through and have not been re-released, with the exception of a live performance of \"10th Man Down\" on the End of Innocence DVD with Marco Hietala (current bass player and male vocalist).
849	In the same year, they also released (as VHS, DVD and CD) their first live album, From Wishes to Eternity, recorded during a show in Tampere, Finland, on December 29, 2000.
850	Soon after the release of Over the Hills and Far Away, Nightwish met what has been described as one of their hardest points as a band.
851	The issues centered on the bassist, Sami Vänskä, who had started misbehaving towards the band, according to Holopainen, by missing appointments and failing to take gigs as seriously as the other members did.
852	After the band discussed his behavior with Vänskä several times, without getting any change, everyone simply stopped caring and tensions grew.
853	Meanwhile, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen had started complaining about his role in the band, feeling like \"a hired gun who would only do what he's asked to\".
854	According to their music teacher, Plamen Dimov, he and Holopainen have totally different characters, and thus difficulties were expected to arise.
855	But Vuorinen was told to stay cool and \"bite the bullet\", and the problem was never addressed again.
856	Later, Holopainen confessed that, at that time, he seriously started thinking about breaking Nightwish up.
857	After a gig in Russia, he sent a text message to fellow musician Tony Kakko of metal band Sonata Arctica, telling him that he did not think he had a band any longer, and asking him what plans he had for next year.
858	After Nightwish's last gig for the Over the Hills and Far Away tour in 2001, Holopainen called their labels Drakkar and Spinefarm, unofficially declaring Nightwish was over.
859	He told them he might produce another album, but he'd never perform another show with the band.
860	The same message was also written on the band's message board.
861	Nightwish's current bassist, Marco Hietala, who replaced Sami Vänskä in late 2001.
862	Straight after the last gig, Holopainen went on a week-long hiking trip to Lapland with Tony Kakko.
863	During the hiking trip, they talked about the band and Holopainen decided he could not break up Nightwish that easily.
864	When he returned from Lapland he immediately received a phone call from Ewo Pohjola, CEO of Spinefarm, offering himself to become their manager and help him straighten things up, and Holopainen agreed.
865	In order to continue with Nightwish, Holopainen decided some changes were in order.
866	Beside choosing Ewo as their new manager, he also asked Vänskä to leave the band.
867	He would later cite musical differences  as another reason for the breakup.
868	Marco Hietala (Tarot) was asked to replace Vänskä, effectively leaving his previous band Sinergy.
869	As well as playing bass guitar, Hietala would also perform male vocals.
870	Holopainen has since said publicly that he and Vänskä still keep in touch, contrary to rumours saying that they have not met since.
871	However, they are not interested in making another project together.
872	In 2002, Nightwish released Century Child, along with the singles \"Ever Dream\" and \"Bless the Child\".
873	The main difference from previous albums is the use of a live Finnish orchestra on the tracks \"Bless the Child\", \"Ever Dream\", \"Feel For You\" and \"The Beauty of the Beast\".
874	An enduring favorite of fans, though, is the band's version of \"The Phantom of the Opera\", from the famous musical of the same name by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.
875	The song was repeatedly played on concerts until vocalist Tarja Turunen was replaced with Anette Olzon, whereupon the band announced that they would never play the song live again.
876	Century Child was certified gold two hours after its release, and platinum two weeks afterwards.
877	It set a record on the Finnish album charts as well: Never before had a first place album been so distant from the second place.
878	After the \"Bless the Child\" music video, a second one was recorded, without any single support.
879	The chosen track was \"End of All Hope\".
880	The clip contains pieces from the Finnish movie, Kohtalon kirja (English: The Book of Fate).
881	In 2003, Nightwish released their second DVD, the documentary End of Innocence.
882	It tells the story of the band in Holopainen, Nevalainen and Tapio Wilska's words for two hours.
883	The documentary also features bits of live concerts, exclusive footage, etc. vocalist Tarja Turunen also got married during the summer of 2003, and there were rumours that the band was about to be dissolved.
884	These rumors were, at the time, proven to be false, as the band continued to play concerts for another year and released another album.
885	Tarja's marriage later played a part in her dismissal from the band in the autumn of 2005.
886	Chart-topping success of Once and Turunen's dismissal (2004–2005)A new album, Once, was released on June 7, 2004, along with its first single, \"Nemo\".
887	The single topped the charts in Finland and Hungary, and reached the charts in six additional countries.
888	\"Nemo\" remains the band's most successful single release to date.
889	Once utilizes a full orchestra in nine of the eleven songs on the album.
890	Unlike Century Child, Nightwish decided to look for an orchestra outside of Finland this time, choosing the London Philharmonic Orchestra.
891	It is also their second album to feature a full-length song in Finnish, \"Kuolema tekee taiteilijan\" (English: \"Death Makes an Artist\").
892	Once has sold triple platinum in Finland, platinum in Germany, and Gold in 6 other countries, it also reached No. 1 in the Greek, Norwegian and German album charts, and charted the Top 10 in France, Hungary and Sweden.
893	The following singles were: \"Wish I Had an Angel\" (featured on the soundtrack of the film Alone in the Dark), \"Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan\" (released only in Finland and Japan) and \"The Siren\".
894	Besides the commercial success, Once was also well received by critics, with many positive reviewers drawing comparisons with Oceanborn.
895	Nightwish live in Jämsä, Finland, on June 25, 2005 The success of the album allowed them to perform the Once World Tour, taking them to play in many countries the band had never visited before.
896	Nightwish performed at the opening ceremony of the 2005 World Championships in Athletics, held in Helsinki, highlighting the acclaim the band had gained.
897	A \"best of\" album, Highest Hopes, was released in September 2005.
898	The compilation also featured a live cover \"High Hopes\" (from the Pink Floyd album The Division Bell) ([//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/Nightwish-highhopes.ogg sample]).
899	Besides \"High Hopes\", a remake of \"Sleeping Sun\" (from Oceanborn) was included on the album and released as a single.
900	A video for the remake was shot, featuring a medieval battle, and can be found on the German release of the single and as a separate DVD released by Spinefarm.
901	The four other members of Nightwish had decided that it was best to continue Nightwish without Turunen.
902	After a concert in the Hartwall Areena (Helsinki) on October 21, 2005, recorded for the live DVD End of an Era (released June 2006), they expressed their decision through an open letter which was given to Turunen by Holopainen, and afterwards posted on the band's website.
903	It was written by Holopainen and signed by all four band members.
904	The main justification given in the letter for Turunen's dismissal was that the band felt that both her husband Marcelo Cabuli (an Argentine businessman) and commercial interests had changed her attitude towards the band.
905	Turunen responded to the incident twice, during press conferences in Finland and Germany, saying that her dismissal came entirely as a shock to her, given that she had not been notified before the letter was given to her.
906	She felt that the personal attacks on her husband were unwarranted, and that playing the issue out in public was \"senselessly cruel\".
907	She expressed these feelings through her own open letter, which was published on her personal website, and through various TV, magazine, and newspaper interviews.
908	Hiatus and arrival of Anette Olzon (2006–2009)In order to find a replacement for Turunen as the female vocalist of the band, on March 17, 2006 the band allowed vocalists interested for the position to send in demo tapes as an audition for the spot.
909	During this time, speculation began to emerge about who would eventually be chosen, and the band stated on their website that fans should not believe any source other than the band itself for information regarding the new vocalist.
910	In the end, the 35-year-old Alyson Avenue's ex-lead singer, Anette Olzon, from Sweden, was chosen.
911	In September 2006, the band entered the studio to record their sixth studio album, Dark Passion Play.
912	In May, next year, Anette Olzon was announced to replace Turunen.
913	Holopainen has said in interviews that he did not wish to reveal her identity until new material was available because he did not want fans judging her by nothing more than a picture, or past work.
914	 The day after this revealing, May 25, 2007, charity single \"Eva\" was released for download only as the first offering from the new album, and the first featuring Olzon.
915	It was originally scheduled for release on 30 May, but the date was changed because of a leak on a British music download site.
916	On June 13, Nightwish revealed the title and artwork for the new album on their official website, as well as the name and cover of the second single (this time CD), \"Amaranth\"; it was released in Finland on August 22 and included a bonus track entitled \"While Your Lips Are Still Red\" written by Tuomas as the main theme track for the upcoming Finnish feature film \"Lieksa!\".
917	The single achieved gold status in Finland after less than two days in stores.
918	Nightwish at signing session in Hamburg, 2007 Dark Passion Play was released around Europe in the last week of September 2007, in the UK on October 1, and the United States on October 2.
919	It was awarded double platinum in Finland the second day after its release and took the number one position on the charts of Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Hungary and Croatia and got in top 100 in other 16 countries, including the United States.
920	On this album, male vocalist Marco Hietala had more freedom in the use of his voice: he sings back up in the songs \"Cadence of Her Last Breath\" and \"Sahara\", lead vocals in the songs \"The Islander\", \"Master Passion Greed\" and \"While Your Lips Are Still Red\", and chorus in the songs \"Bye Bye Beautiful\" and \"7 Days to the Wolves\".
921	He also sings one part in \"The Poet and the Pendulum\", besides singing back up in the chorus.
922	Before the band found the new singer and the album was recorded, Marco sang on all the demo versions.
923	Holopainen also sang on the demo versions of \"Bye Bye Beautiful\" and \"Master Passion Greed\" but these songs have never been released.
924	On September 22, 2007, the band hosted a secret concert at Rock Café in Tallinn, Estonia, disguising itself as a Nightwish cover band called \"Nachtwasser\".
925	Their first official concert with Olzon was in Tel Aviv, Israel, on October 6, 2007.
926	The Dark Passion Play tour thus started, visiting the United States, Canada, most of Europe, Asia, and Australia.
927	Nightwish live in Paris, France, on April 6, 2008 The third single of the album was \"Erämaan viimeinen\", a previously unreleased vocal version of the instrumental \"Last of the Wilds\".
928	It was released in Finland only on December 5, 2007.
929	On this song, Jonsu of the Finnish pop and rock band Indica performs the Finnish vocals.
930	\"Bye Bye Beautiful\", the fourth single, was released on February 15, 2008, and concerns the 2005 dismissal of Turunen, as does one other song on the album (Master Passion Greed).
931	The single includes yet another bonus track, \"Escapist\", which is also included on the Japanese version of Dark Passion Play.
932	Within a week after the release, the fifth single was announced to be \"The Islander\".
933	It was released over a month after the release of its music video, shot in late 2007 in Rovaniemi in Finnish Lapland.
934	The Dark Passion Play tour turned out to be Nightwish's longest tour yet, lasting from late 2007 to September 2009 when it ended with a concert in Hartwall Arena – the band's second concert there – with the band Apocalyptica.
935	On March 6, 2009, Nightwish released a new live EP/DVD entitled Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places).
936	The eight live tracks were recorded during the \"Dark Passion Play World Tour\" in 2007–2008, and the album also includes one b-side from the \"Bye Bye Beautiful\" single, one b-side from the \"Amaranth\" single, a previously unreleased demo version of \"Cadence of Her Last Breath\", and a bonus-DVD with three music videos as well as a 37-minute documentary called Back in the Day is Now.
937	Imaginaerum and Olzon's dismissal (2009–2012)In the June 2009 edition of the Finnish magazine Soundi, Holopainen stated that he had started work on a new Nightwish album.
938	In October 2009, rumors about the new album's name were going around with the title Wind Embraced, but lead vocalist Anette Olzon listed the rumors as \"not true\" and said that the songs for the new album had not yet been completed apart from three songs written before May 2009.
939	Holopainen said in a 2010 interview that \"[...]I can't reveal to you any more but there is going to be a big twist so to say, on the next album.\"
940	In an interview with Uilleann pipist Troy Donockley (who recorded with the band on Dark Passion Play), when asked about his involvement in the new album, he stated \"Oh yes, I will be playing on the next album and from what Tuomas has told me, it is going to be something extraordinary...\"
941	On February 1, 2010, Olzon stated on her blog that Holopainen had nine songs ready for the new album.
942	In April 2010, Holopainen revealed on the Nightwish homepage that he had finished writing the songs, and on June 2, it was announced that he had finished recording the pre-production demo.
943	The band announced in late 2010 that more information on the album's actual content would be released in late January, but on February 1, the official website bore a statement written by Holopainen that because of the schedule changes he can't yet give away as much details as he would have wanted, but more information will be out after a couple of months.
944	He added, however, that \"it still is the Burton-Gaiman-Dalí - amusement park we are about to enter\"; In the same statement it was revealed that the album will be a theme album and \"mood changes seem to be more present than ever before\", and the orchestration demos he had received from Pip Williams were described as \"beautiful, twisted, tribal and cinematic stuff\".
945	In the Finnish version of the statement, it was also revealed that a few songs will not get any orchestrations at all, differing from their latest album on which all songs had the background orchestra.
946	Announcements continued throughout 2011.
947	On February 10, Nightwish announced on their website that the new album title would be Imaginaerum.
948	They also declared that the band had been preparing a movie based on the album, which would be released in 2012 and directed by Stobe Harju, who previously directed the music video for \"The Islander\".
949	On August 22, 2011, it was announced on their official website that the album of Imaginaerum would be released at the end of the year.
950	On August 31, Nightwish announced on their website their decision to change Imaginarium title to Imaginaerum \"
951	In order to avoid mix-ups with various things named 'Imaginarium'\".
952	Then on September 2, Nightwish announced on their website that the new single called \"Storytime\" will be released on Friday, November 11 and on September 9, Nightwish revealed the cover and tracklist.
953	Nightwish performing with Elize Ryd and Alissa White-Gluz in Denver, Colorado, who filled in for Anette Olzon, who parted ways with the band afterwards.
954	On January 11, 2012, Nightwish announced on their website that the second single \"The Crow, the Owl and the Dove\" would be released on February 29.
955	Roadrunner Records announced that Nightwish would be releasing a 10-inch LP titled Trials of Imaginaerum in conjunction with Record Store Day  (April 21, 2012).
956	The 10\" LP is a two-sided picture disk, which contains four early demos of \"Storytime\", \"The Crow, The Owl and The Dove\", \"I Want My Tears Back\" and \"Slow, Love, Slow\".
957	On October 1, 2012, Nightwish announced via their Facebook page that they were parting ways with Olzon.
958	According to the press statement, \"it has become increasingly obvious that the direction and the needs of the band were in conflict, and this has led to a division from which we cannot recover\".
959	This announcement came days after Olzon fell ill at a show in Denver, Colorado and was unable to perform.
960	Nightwish used replacement singers from the opening band, Kamelot, and Olzon later expressed her disappointment, saying \"I was never asked if it was OK that they used Elize and Alissa in the show [Friday] night [...]
961	I don't think it's a good decision they made and I'm sorry for those of you who came to see the whole band but got something else.
962	But I was very ill and this decision
963	wasn't mine.\"
964	According to the statement, Dutch singer Floor Jansen (ex-After Forever, ReVamp) would sing for the remainder of the Imaginaerum World Tour.
965	On January 11, 2013, Olzon announced on her official blog that she was pregnant with her third child, due in spring 2013.
966	This was a contributing factor to her being dismissed.
967	The band then released a statement on their website declaring that the reason Olzon gave for her dismissal and other statements she made were untrue and that Olzon herself had agreed to help find a replacement while she was on maternity leave.
968	Later on, Olzon gave several interviews in which she told that she never agreed with a replacement, even when she was pregnant, and proposed to the band to postpone the tour, culminating on her firing.
969	She also added that she was against Jansen joining the band in her period of maternity, mainly because of the difference in their vocal styles.
970	In a 2015 interview, Holopainen said the band \"emerged stronger\" from the line-up changes it went through.
971	Endless Forms Most Beautiful, arrival of Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley (2013–present)In an interview with Metal Hammer in November 2012, Tuomas Holopainen stated that they already had a rehearsal place booked from July 2014 to September 2014, but before they began rehearsing the band members would be taking a break from Nightwish for several months.
972	On October 9, 2013, Nightwish announced Jansen as the permanent replacement for Olzon.
973	Troy Donockley was also announced as a full-time member, making the band become a sextet for the first time.
974	In a later interview, Tuomas said that because of Donockley's previous work with Nightwish already made him \"much a band member\", so the band just \"made it official\".
975	According to the band's webpage, the band would enter the studio in 2014 to record their eighth full-length album for a 2015 release.
976	At that time the band already announced that it would contain Nightwish's longest song to date.
977	At the end of November, the band released the live album Showtime, Storytime.
978	Despite the recording happening when they were only tour members, it is the first Nightwish release to feature Jansen, and to have her and Donockley credited as band members.
979	The album also carries a documentary containing the behind-the-scenes of Jansen's first days in the band and the process of replacing Olzon.
980	In May 2014, Tuomas updated his official website, stating that he and producer Tero \"TeeCee\" Kinnunen have been recording 12 demos (and possibly 3 bonus tracks) for the new album in Hattula, Finland.
981	The band expected to start rehearsing in July in Eno, Finland, with the recording finished in January 2015, and the album released in Spring that year, \"If everything goes as scheduled\".
982	Commenting on the music, Tuomas said:It's still too early to analyze the material more closely, but the album will once again explore all the ends of the spectrum, bringing the very best out of the newcomers' Floor and Troy.
983	And stealthily the album ended up having a theme running through it.
984	On August 6, the band announced that founding member and drummer Jukka Nevalainen would not be part of the upcoming album due to his very difficult insomnia.
985	Kai Hahto (Wintersun) would be taking his place in the album and the upcoming tour.
986	Evolutionary biologist and author Richard Dawkins was announced as a guest star on the album, with Holopainen stating that he had \"been so enthusiastic about this kind of literature for the past few months, and will be for the upcoming months, that it's going to come out somehow.

991	The album features the participation of London's The Metro Voices choir group, London's Young Musicians Children‘s Choir, and the Orchestre De Grandeur led by the esteemed orchestral arranger Pip Williams, who teaches Music and Music Technology at the London College of Music.
992	Professor Richard Dawkins not only narrates the introduction to the album's opener, \"Shudder Before the Beautiful,\" but also the album's closer, \"The Greatest Show on Earth,\" which takes its name from his 2009 book on evolution.
993	The album sold in its first week 18,342 copies in the US and debuted at 34 on the Billboard 200, making it Nightwish's third album (after Dark Passion Play and Imaginaerum) to chart in this category.
994	In the Czech Republic, the album debuted atop the charts and received gold-status after just two days.
995	The album charted in top 10 in other countries as well, including Finland, Netherlands, Poland, Austria, and Mexico.
996	In the support of album's release the band embarked on an Endless Forms Most Beautiful World Tour, which started on April 9, 2015 in New York, USA and ended on October 9, 2016 in Saitama, Japan.

1006	On June 9, 2017, the band announced that March 9, 2018, would mark both the debut of a nine-month world tour titled Decades: World Tour, which had concluded in December that same year, and the release of a new compilation album, titled Decades.
1007	The tour featured \"rarely heard material\" and a special set for fans; on the US and Canadian portion of the tour, every audience member was offered the Decades album for free.
1008	During the Latin American leg of the tour, the São Paulo and Buenos Aires shows were filmed for a live DVD.
1009	In July 2018, Holopainen stated that he had written \"80 or 90%\" of the material for Nightwish's next album, which would consist of ten or eleven songs; he stated that the inspiration for a new album came from the completion of the 2018 self-titled debut album of Auri, a band he created with Donockley and Johanna Kurkela the previous year.
1010	Recording will start in July 2019, for a planned Spring 2020 release.
1011	The band will \"use the [orchestral] instrumentation in a different way than before\", with Holopainen stating \"You want to search for some new ways of using it so that it doesn't end up sounding the same as before.\"
1012	Jansen stated in November that she believed the recording process would be similar to Endless Forms Most Beautiful's, for which the band went through lengthy rehearsals before starting to record.
1013	MusicMusical styleThe use of keyboard through traditional piano and strings to create a gothic atmosphere is an important part of Nightwish's original music.
1014	Earlier Nightwish performs symphonic metal with soaring female operatic vocals.
1015	Their music has been described as \"bombastic heavy, symphonic and cinematic, with keyboards and strings creating a gothic atmosphere\".
1016	They have also been known to play power metal and gothic metal.
1017	The band's music is also known to be complex and layered.
1018	Their approach is epic, theatrical and operatic.
1019	Critic Chad Bowar notes that the music is \"always very melodic with memorable choruses and a lot of hooks.\"A part of Nightwish's original sound was the soprano vocals of Tarja Turunen, until her departure from the band in 2005.
1020	The usage of a female vocalist has become a sort of trademark, though less so since the outbreak of new female fronted metal bands in the mid-2000s with the popularization of bands such as Evanescence and Within Temptation as well as several gothic metal bands mixing female and male vocals, such as Lacuna Coil, Tristania, Epica and After Forever.
1021	Bassist and vocalist Marco Hietala describes the style of the band's music as \"melodic symphonic metal;\" though this is not a view shared by all members of the group, including band composer Tuomas Holopainen, who describes the band as simply symphonic metal.
1022	Some critics find that the band had a gothic sound since their debut.
1023	The music of Nightwish had been \"distinguished by the operatic voice\" of soprano Tarja Turunen, a \"charismatic frontwoman with a powerful voice\".
1024	Critics observed that her vocals became less operatic with the release of Once.
1025	Following the departure of Tarja Turunen from the group, Nightwish left behind the \"signature operatic vocals\" of their earlier albums.
1026	While the music of Nightwish is centered around a female lead singer, the band has also featured some male vocals on their albums ever since their debut release Angels Fall First.
1027	This debut album also included \"elements of folk music and ambience\" that were discarded on their subsequent album Oceanborn.
1028	However, the song \"Creek Mary's Blood\" from the album \"Once\" featured some use of folk-oriented Native American melodies, and their 2007 release Dark Passion Play featured folk music elements on the songs \"The Islander\" and \"Last of the Wilds\".
1029	Lyrical themesIn the beginning, Holopainen mainly wrote about mythological and fantasy themes, and often used references to \"metaphysics and nature\".
1030	Fantasy novels especially are a big influence on Nightwish's lyrics.
1031	Songs such as \"Wishmaster,\" \"Elvenpath,\" and \"Wanderlust\" make fairly clear references to fantasy novels, in this case the Dragonlance series and J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.
1032	\"FantasMic\" from Wishmaster is a direct tribute to Walt Disney and Disney animated films, which Holopainen has said are among his influences.
1033	Dark Passion Play featured the return to the fantasy theme with songs such as \"Sahara\", \"Whoever Brings the Night\" and \"7 Days to the Wolves\", which is loosely based on Stephen King's novel Wolves of the Calla, the fifth book in the Dark Tower series.
1034	The song The Poet and the Pendulum's first section is called \"The White Lands of Empathica\", which is a reference to the seventh book in the Dark Tower series.
1035	Through the years, the lyrics became more personal.
1036	\"Dead Boy's Poem\" from Wishmaster is a very emotional piece, which Holopainen calls his \"legacy and [...] testament for the whole world.
1037	[...] I wanted to do this song before I die because I wanted to tell the whole world what I think and feel.
1038	It expresses a lot of myself.\"
1039	The personal development became even more obvious on the Wishmaster-successor Century Child.
1040	Turunen thinks that the lyrics do not anymore deal \"with the dreamland we were used to, but with the brutal reality of life.
1041	\"\"Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan\" (in English, \"Death Makes an Artist\") from Once describes the experience of loss and its impact on art, \"Nemo\" deals with the feeling of being lost, while \"Dead Gardens\" deals with a bout of artist's block Holopainen suffered from.
1042	\"Creek Mary's Blood\" is based on Dee Brown's story of the same name, which presents the situation of Native Americans at the end of the 19th century.
1043	2007's Dark Passion Play included an unusual amount of personal songs, including \"The Poet and the Pendulum\" which has been described as Holopainen's life story, and about being a composer and musician.
1044	Another song, \"Meadows of Heaven\" is a depiction of Holopainen's childhood and the feeling that it'll never return.
1045	Two songs, \"Bye Bye Beautiful\" and \"Master Passion Greed\" are about ex-member Tarja Turunen and her husband Marcelo Cabuli.
1046	Another song on the album, \"Cadence of Her Last Breath\", is a \"very personal song\" about running away.
1047	The album also contains many references to authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Walt Whitman.
1048	Imaginaerum tracks has different lyrical themes: for example, a song \"Ghost River\" themed battle between the Devil and Mother Gaia while \"Scaretale\" themed childhood nightmares.
1049	On Endless Forms Most Beautiful lyrical themes included songs about \"the beauty of the world and everything it has to offer\" (\"Shudder Before The Beautiful\"), critic about how some religions restrict people lives (\"Weak Fantasy\"),  and \"the meaning of life, which can be something different for all of us\" (Élan).
1050	Although the lyrics of Nightwish generally are serious with dark meanings, they have also produced several less serious songs, including the bonus track \"Nightquest\", which talks about the band members' (the three original members as well as Nevalainen) connection as musicians, and the \"quest\" of Nightwish.
1051	LanguageNightwish's debut album Angels Fall First had one song in the Finnish language, but since then the band has only written songs in English, with the only exceptions being \"Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan\" from the Once album (2004), the single \"Erämaan viimeinen\" (2007), which is a vocal version of the instrumental \"Last of the Wilds\", and \"Taikatalvi\" (\"Magic Winter\") from Imaginaerum (2011).
1052	Holopainen thought that he was very uncertain about the lyrics of \"Erämaan viimeinen\", because he is of the opinion that writing in Finnish is rather hard, and has said that \"Finnish [could] quickly sound really cheesy.\"InfluenceTuomas Holopainen, writer of most of the band's lyrics and music, says that he gets most of the inspiration for Nightwish's songs from film music.
1053	Songs like \"Beauty of the Beast\" (from Century Child), \"Ghost Love Score\" (from Once) and \"The Poet and the Pendulum\" (from Dark Passion Play) are examples of this influence.
1054	Holopainen has also said that film music is the music he listens to for leisure.
1055	He likes, for example, the musical scores to The Village, Van Helsing, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Crimson Tide, and practically everything written by Hans Zimmer.
1056	Other songs, such as \"Bye Bye Beautiful\" (from Dark Passion Play), and \"Wish I Had an Angel\" (from Once) have elements of industrial metal, and some others, like \"The Islander\" and \"Last of the Wilds\" (from Dark Passion Play), \"Creek Mary's Blood\" (from Once), and the Angels Fall First album have elements of folk music.
1057	Bands stated as an influence on Nightwish include Children of Bodom, Theatre of Tragedy, The Gathering, My Dying Bride, Tiamat and The 3rd and the Mortal.
1058	Nightwish has also been noted as a source of inspiration for other bands.
1059	Simone Simons, lead singer of Dutch symphonic/gothic metal band Epica, stated that she began singing because of Nightwish's 1998 Oceanborn album.
1060	Sander Gommans of After Forever said that Nightwish \"will certainly influence us in creating new songs\".
1061	Power metal band Sonata Arctica's lead singer Tony Kakko has explained how much of an influence Nightwish is to him.
1062	In December 2015, Metal Hammer's Dave Everley described them as \"mainland Europe's most successful metal band, give or take a Rammstein\".

1082	2002 novella by Neil Gaiman.
1083	CoralineCoraline.jpgFront cover by Dave McKeanNeil GaimanDave McKean
1084	Dave MckeanUnited KingdomEnglishDark fantasyBloomsbury (UK)Harper Collins (US)24 February 2002Print, e-book, audiobook1638130-06-113937-871822484PZ7.G1273 Co 2002Coraline  is a dark fantasy children's novella by British author Neil Gaiman, published in 2002 by Bloomsbury and Harper Collins.
1085	It was awarded the 2003 Hugo Award for Best Novella, the 2003 Nebula Award for Best Novella, and the 2002 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers.
1086	The titular character's name came from a typo in \"Caroline\".
1087	According to Gaiman, \"I had typed the name Caroline, and it came out wrong.
1088	I looked at the word Coraline, and knew it was someone's name.
1089	I wanted to know what happened to her.\"
1090	It has been compared to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and has been adapted into a 2009 stop-motion film, directed by Henry Selick.
1091	PlotCoraline Jones and her parents move into an old house that has been divided into flats.
1092	The other tenants include Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, two elderly women retired from the stage and Mr. Bobinsky (Originally Mr. Bobo in this book), initially referred to as \"the crazy old man upstairs\", who claims to be training a mouse circus.
1093	The flat beside Coraline's is unoccupied, and a small door that links them is revealed to be bricked up when opened.
1094	Coraline goes to visit her new neighbours.
1095	Mr. Bobinsky relays to her a message from his mice: \"Don't go through the door.\"
1096	Coraline also has tea with Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, and Miss Spink spies danger in Coraline’s future after reading her tea leaves.
1097	Later, when Coraline's parents go missing due to the other mother taking them, Miss Spink then gives her a lucky stone with a hole in the middle, which is supposed to be \"good for bad things\", but Miss Forcible says it's, \"good for lost things\".
1098	Despite these warnings, Coraline decides to unlock the door when she is home by herself.
1099	This time, she finds the brick wall behind the door is gone.
1100	In its place is a long hallway that leads to a flat identical to her own, except inhabited by the \"Other Mother\" and \"Other Father,\" who have black buttons for eyes.
1101	The Other Mother is notably taller and thinner than her real mother.
1102	Her black hair seems to move by itself, her skin is paper-white, and her nails are long and red.
1103	Coraline finds the \"Other World\" more interesting than her own; the Other Mother cooks food that she actually enjoys, both of her Other Parents pay more attention to her, her toy box is filled with animate toys that can move and fly, the Other Miss Spink and Miss Forcible perform a never-ending act in their flat, and the Other Mr. Bobinsky performs a mice circus.
1104	She even finds that the feral black cat that wanders around the house in the real world can talk.
1105	The cat identifies itself as the same cat that lives in the real world, and possesses the ability to travel through the gaps between the two worlds.
1106	Although intentionally rude and unhelpful for the greater part of the conversation, it briefly praises her for bringing \"protection\", then vanishes.
1107	After Coraline returns to the copy of her flat, the Other Mother offers Coraline the opportunity to stay in the Other World forever, but in order to do so, Coraline must allow buttons to be sewn into her eyes.
1108	Coraline is horrified and returns through the door to her home.
1109	Upon return to her apartment, Coraline finds that her real parents are missing.
1110	They do not return the next day, and the black cat wakes her and takes her to a mirror in her hallway, through which she can see her trapped parents.
1111	They signal to her by writing \"Help Us\" on the glass, from which Coraline deduces the Other Mother has kidnapped them.
1112	Though frightened of returning, Coraline goes back to the Other World to confront the Other Mother and rescue her parents.
1113	In the garden, Coraline is prompted by the cat to challenge the Other Mother, as \"her kind of thing loves games and challenges.\"
1114	The Other Mother tries to convince Coraline to stay, but Coraline refuses, and is locked within a small space behind a mirror as punishment.
1115	In the small dark closet space, she meets three ghost children.
1116	Each had in the past let the Other Mother, who they archaically refer to as the \"beldam ,\" sew buttons over their eyes.
1117	They tell Coraline how the Other Mother eventually grew bored with them, leaving them to die and cast them aside, but they are trapped there because she has kept their souls.
1118	If their souls can be rescued from the Other Mother, then the ghosts can pass on.
1119	The ghost children implore Coraline to escape and avoid their fate.
1120	After the Other Mother releases Coraline from the mirror, Coraline proposes a game: if she can find the ghost children's souls and her parents, then she, her parents, and the ghost children may go free.
1121	If she loses, then Coraline will let the Other Mother sew the buttons into her eyes and become a loving daughter to her.
1122	The Other Mother agrees and they both swear on their right hands.
1123	Coraline searches through the Other World and overcomes the Other Mother's obstacles by using her wits and Miss Spink's lucky stone to find the marble-like souls of the ghost children.
1124	She also deduces that her parents are imprisoned in a snow globe on the mantelpiece.
1125	The ghost children warn her that even if Coraline wins, the Other Mother will not let them go, so Coraline tricks the Other Mother by announcing that she knows where her parents are hidden: in the passageway between the worlds.
1126	The Other Mother cannot resist gloating by opening the door to show Coraline that her parents are not there.
1127	When the Other Mother opens the door Coraline throws the cat at the Other Mother, grabs the snow globe, and escapes to the real world with the key, and the cat quickly follows.
1128	While escaping, Coraline forces the door shut on the Other Mother's hand.
1129	Back in her home, Coraline falls asleep on a chair.
1130	She is awoken by her parents who have no memory of the events.
1131	That night, Coraline has a dream in which she meets the three children at a picnic.
1132	The children are dressed in clothes from different periods and one seems to have wings.
1133	They warn her that her task is still not done: the Other Mother will attempt to get her back and will try to get the key to open the door between the worlds.
1134	Coraline goes to the old well in the woods to dispose of the key.
1135	She pretends to have a picnic, with the picnic blanket laid over the entrance to the well.
1136	The Other Mother's severed hand attempts to seize the key, but steps on the blanket and falls into the well.
1137	Coraline returns to the house, greeting her neighbours (who finally get her name right), and getting ready for school tomorrow.
1138	CharactersCoraline Jones – The young explorer.
1139	She is curious, intelligent, resourceful, and courageous.
1140	Coraline is often irritated by rain, crazy grown-ups (as they all seem to be), and not being taken seriously because of her young age.
1141	She's described as being \"small for her age\", but Coraline is not afraid to face anyone; she is the most adventurous person in the book.
1142	Mrs. Jones – Coraline's mother.
1143	She is very busy most of the time, and sometimes a little inattentive, but she loves and cares about Coraline.
1144	She is nice, and helpful, though Coraline considers her to be rather boring.
1145	Coraline also gets annoyed with her real mother because she doesn't seem to want to let Coraline \"fit in\".
1146	In the film, her first name is Mel.
1147	Mr. Jones – Coraline's father.
1148	He works at his house on the computer.
1149	He cares about Coraline very much and is kind, brave, and helpful.
1150	He makes interesting food creations that Coraline strongly dislikes.
1151	He, too, is usually too busy to spend time with Coraline.
1152	In the film, his first name is Charlie.
1153	The Cat – A black cat from Coraline's world.
1154	The cat acts as a mentor to Coraline and guides her through her journey.
1155	It claims to have no name, explaining that cats do not need names to tell each other apart.
1156	Unlike many of the characters in the novel, it does not have an \"Other World\" counterpart, saying that unlike other creatures in the world, cats can \"keep themselves together\".
1157	It moves freely from one world to the other, although it seems to be only able to talk in the Other World.
1158	It is very sarcastic, though helpful to Coraline.
1159	It's defiant of the Other Mother, but seems to tremble at the thought of being stuck in the Other Mother's world.
1160	It befriends Coraline and helps her escape from the Other Mother, though Coraline also uses it as a weapon without its permission.
1161	The Other Mother – The creature that created much of the Other World and the main villain of the novel.
1162	She looks similar to Coraline's real mother but taller and thinner, with long black hair that seems to move by itself, black button eyes, paper-white skin, and extremely long, twitchy fingers with long dark red nails.
1163	 During the course of the novel, she grows taller, thinner, and paler, looking less and less like Coraline's mother.
1164	She cannot create, but only copy, twist and change things from the real world when constructing her version of it.
1165	She collects children, whom she loves possessively to the point of eventual destruction.
1166	She mainly wants someone to mother.
1167	It's implied that she killed her own mother because when Coraline asked her if she had a grave she replied \"Oh yes, I put her there myself.\"
1168	In the film her true form is a skeletal-arachnoid creature.
1169	She is referred to several times as \"the beldam \", a Middle English word meaning \"grandmother\", \"ugly old woman\", \"hag\", or \"witch\", and also used to refer to creatures of fairy.
1170	The Other Father – A creation of the Other Mother, the Other Father is used to help trick Coraline into staying in the Other Mother's world.
1171	Like her real father, he has a study and sits there during the day and will not talk to Coraline for long.
1172	He does not work, however; he merely occupies the study, as he is not permitted to talk to Coraline by himself.
1173	He is much more fun than Coraline's real father and always tries to be cheerful and fun in front of Coraline.
1174	In reality, the Other Father is sad and nervous.
1175	The Other Mother ends up punishing him for revealing too much to Coraline—she transforms him into a grub-like creature, and orders the Other Father to trap Coraline so she cannot win her challenge, but Coraline escapes.
1176	Miss Spink and Miss Forcible – A pair of retired actresses who live in the flat under Coraline's.
1177	They own many ageing Scotties, such as Hamish, Angus, and Jock, and talk in theater jargon, often referencing their time as actresses.
1178	They recognize the danger Coraline is in after reading her fortune through tea leaves and give her a stone with a hole in it to help protect her.
1179	In the Other World they are young, pretty, and perform continuously in front of many different dogs, who, in the Other World, are anthropomorphic.
1180	Mr. Bobo – A retired circus performer living in the flat above Coraline's; he is commonly referred to as the Crazy Old Man Upstairs.
1181	Over the course of the book he claims to be training mice to perform in a mouse circus, and often brings Coraline messages from them, though at first Coraline doubts he even has mice to train, and doesn't listen to what he says to be messages from the mice.
1182	His counterpart in the Other World trains rats, and is in fact made of rats.
1183	(In the film adaptation, this character is named Mr. Bobinsky.)
1184	The three ghost children – The spirits of three children who were previous victims of the Other Mother: two girls and one boy.
1185	The boy is described as having a dirty face and red trousers.
1186	One of the girls has brown hair, a pink blouse and a pink skirt.
1187	The other has a brown bonnet and brown dress.
1188	They were trapped by the other mother at different times before Coraline, and reside in the dark space behind the mirror.
1189	After having their souls restored, they go to the afterlife, but not before meeting Coraline for a last time, in a dream where she picnics with them.
1190	Here, she sees their true appearances and they thank her for freeing them from the Other Mother.
1191	They also warn her that the other mother is not done with her.
