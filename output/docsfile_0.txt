8	It was founded in 1871 when the south German states, except for Austria, joined the North German Confederation.
9	On 1 January 1871, the new constitution came into force that changed the name of the federal state and introduced the title of emperor for Wilhelm I, King of Prussia from the House of Hohenzollern.
10	Berlin remained its capital, and Otto von Bismarck remained Chancellor, the head of government.
11	As these events occurred, the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War.
12	The German Empire consisted of 26 states, most of them ruled by royal families.
13	They included four kingdoms, six grand duchies, five duchies (six before 1876), seven principalities, three free Hanseatic cities, and one imperial territory.
14	Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm, it contained about two thirds of Germany's population and territory.
15	Prussian dominance was also established constitutionally.
16	After 1850, the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized, with particular strengths in coal, iron (and later steel), chemicals, and railways.
17	In 1871, Germany had a population of 41 million people; by 1913, this had increased to 68 million.
18	A heavily rural collection of states in 1815, the now united Germany became predominantly urban.
19	During its 47 years of existence, the German Empire was an industrial, technological, and scientific giant, gaining more Nobel Prizes in science than any other country.
20	By 1900, Germany was the largest economy in Europe, surpassing the United Kingdom, as well as the second-largest in the world, behind only the United States.
21	From 1867 to 1878/9, Otto von Bismarck's tenure as the first and to this day longest reigning Chancellor was marked by relative liberalism, but it became more conservative afterwards.
22	Broad reforms and the Kulturkampf marked his period in the office.
23	Late in Bismarck's chancellorship and in spite of his personal opposition, Germany became involved in colonialism.
24	Claiming much of the leftover territory that was yet unclaimed in the Scramble for Africa, it managed to build the third-largest colonial empire after the British and the French ones.
25	As a colonial state, it sometimes clashed with other European powers, especially the British Empire.
26	Germany became a great power, boasting a rapidly developing rail network, the world's strongest army, and a fast-growing industrial base.
27	In less than a decade, its navy became second only to Britain's Royal Navy.
28	After the removal of Otto von Bismarck by Wilhelm II in 1890, the Empire embarked on Weltpolitik – a bellicose new course that ultimately contributed to the outbreak of World War I.
29	In addition, Bismarck's successors were incapable of maintaining their predecessor's complex, shifting, and overlapping alliances which had kept Germany from being diplomatically isolated.
30	This period was marked by various factors influencing the Emperor's decisions, which were often perceived as contradictory or unpredictable by the public.
31	In 1879, the German Empire consolidated the Dual Alliance with Austria-Hungary, followed by the Triple Alliance with Italy in 1882.
32	It also retained strong diplomatic ties to the Ottoman Empire.
33	When the great crisis of 1914 arrived, Italy left the alliance and the Ottoman Empire formally allied with Germany.
34	In the First World War, German plans to capture Paris quickly in the autumn of 1914 failed.
35	 The war on the Western Front became a stalemate.
36	The Allied naval blockade caused severe shortages of food.
37	However, Imperial Germany had  success on the Eastern Front; it occupied a large amount of territory to its east following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.
38	The German declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare in early 1917, contributed to bringing the United States into the war.
39	The high command under Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff increasingly controlled the country, but in October after the failed offensive in spring 1918, the German armies were in retreat, allies Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire had collapsed, and Bulgaria had surrendered.
40	The Empire collapsed in the November 1918 Revolution with the abdications of its monarchs.
41	This left a postwar federal republic and a devastated and unsatisfied populace, which later led to the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazism.
42	HistoryBackgroundOtto von Bismarck, the visionary statesman who unified Germany with the help of his skillful political moves and the exploitation of encountered opportunities The German Confederation had been created by an act of the Congress of Vienna on 8 June 1815 as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, after being alluded to in Article 6  of the 1814 Treaty of Paris.
43	German nationalism rapidly shifted from its liberal and democratic character in 1848, called Pan-Germanism, to Prussian prime minister Otto von Bismarck's pragmatic Realpolitik.
44	Bismarck sought to extend Hohenzollern hegemony throughout the German states; to do so meant unification of the German states and the exclusion of Prussia's main German rival, Austria, from the subsequent German Empire.
45	He envisioned a conservative, Prussian-dominated Germany.
46	Three wars led to military successes and helped to persuade German people to do this: the Second Schleswig War against Denmark in 1864, the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, and the Franco-Prussian War against France in 1870–71.
47	The German Confederation ended as a result of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 between the constituent Confederation entities of the Austrian Empire and its allies on one side and the Kingdom of Prussia and its allies on the other.
48	The war resulted in the partial replacement of the Confederation in 1867 by a North German Confederation, comprising the 22 states north of the Main.
49	The patriotic fervour generated by the Franco-Prussian War overwhelmed the remaining opposition to a unified Germany (aside from Austria) in the four states south of the Main and during November 1870 they joined the North German Confederation by treaty.
50	FoundationOn 10 December 1870, the North German Confederation Reichstag renamed the Confederation the \"German Empire\" and gave the title of German Emperor to William I, the King of Prussia, as Bundespräsidium of the Confederation.
51	The new constitution (Constitution of the German Confederation) and the title Emperor came into effect on 1 January 1871.
52	During the Siege of Paris on 18 January 1871, William accepted to be proclaimed Emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles.
53	The second German Constitution, adopted by the Reichstag on 14 April 1871 and proclaimed by the Emperor on 16 April, was substantially based upon Bismarck's North German Constitution.
54	The political system remained the same.
55	The empire had a parliament called the Reichstag, which was elected by universal male suffrage.
56	However, the original constituencies drawn in 1871 were never redrawn to reflect the growth of urban areas.
57	As a result, by the time of the great expansion of German cities in the 1890s and 1900s, rural areas were grossly over-represented.

60	At centre (in white): Otto von Bismarck, first Chancellor of Germany, Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, Prussian Chief of Staff.
61	Legislation also required the consent of the Bundesrat, the federal council of deputies from the 27 states.
62	Executive power was vested in the emperor, or Kaiser, who was assisted by a chancellor responsible only to him.
63	The emperor was given extensive powers by the constitution.
64	He alone appointed and dismissed the chancellor (so in practice the emperor ruled the empire through the chancellor), was supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and final arbiter of all foreign affairs, and could also disband the Reichstag to call for new elections.
65	Officially, the chancellor was a one-man cabinet and was responsible for the conduct of all state affairs; in practice, the State Secretaries (bureaucratic top officials in charge of such fields as finance, war, foreign affairs, etc.) acted as unofficial portfolio ministers.
66	The Reichstag had the power to pass, amend, or reject bills and to initiate legislation.
67	However, as mentioned above, in practice the real power was vested in the emperor, who exercised it through his chancellor.
68	Although nominally a federal empire and league of equals, in practice, the empire was dominated by the largest and most powerful state, Prussia.
69	Prussia stretched across the northern two-thirds of the new Reich and contained three-fifths of its population.
70	The imperial crown was hereditary in the ruling house of Prussia, the House of Hohenzollern.
71	With the exception of 1872–1873 and 1892–1894, the chancellor was always simultaneously the prime minister of Prussia.
72	With 17 out of 58 votes in the Bundesrat, Berlin needed only a few votes from the smaller states to exercise effective control.
73	The other states retained their own governments, but had only limited aspects of sovereignty.
74	For example, both postage stamps and currency were issued for the empire as a whole.
75	Coins through one mark were also minted in the name of the empire, while higher-valued pieces were issued by the states.
76	However, these larger gold and silver issues were virtually commemorative coins and had limited circulation.
77	While the states issued their own decorations and some had their own armies, the military forces of the smaller ones were put under Prussian control.
78	Those of the larger states, such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Saxony, were coordinated along Prussian principles and would in wartime be controlled by the federal government.
79	The evolution of the German Empire is somewhat in line with parallel developments in Italy, which became a united nation-state a decade earlier.
80	Some key elements of the German Empire's authoritarian political structure were also the basis for conservative modernization in Imperial Japan under Meiji and the preservation of an authoritarian political structure under the tsars in the Russian Empire.
81	One factor in the social anatomy of these governments was the retention of a very substantial share in political power by the landed elite, the Junkers, resulting from the absence of a revolutionary breakthrough by the peasants in combination with urban areas.
82	Although authoritarian in many respects, the empire had some democratic features.
83	Besides universal suffrage, it permitted the development of political parties.
84	Bismarck's intention was to create a constitutional façade which would mask the continuation of authoritarian policies.
85	In the process, he created a system with a serious flaw.
86	There was a significant disparity between the Prussian and German electoral systems.
87	Prussia used a highly restrictive three-class voting system in which the richest third of the population could choose 85% of the legislature, all but assuring a conservative majority.
88	As mentioned above, the king and (with two exceptions) the prime minister of Prussia were also the emperor and chancellor of the empire – meaning that the same rulers had to seek majorities from legislatures elected from completely different franchises.
89	Universal suffrage was significantly diluted by gross over-representation of rural areas from the 1890s onward.
90	By the turn of the century, the urban-rural population balance was completely reversed from 1871; more than two-thirds of the empire's people lived in cities and towns.
91	Bismarck eraOtto von Bismarck Bismarck's domestic policies played an important role in forging the authoritarian political culture of the Kaiserreich.
92	Less preoccupied by continental power politics following unification in 1871, Germany's semi-parliamentary government carried out a relatively smooth economic and political revolution from above that pushed them along the way towards becoming the world's leading industrial power of the time.
93	Bismarck's \"revolutionary conservatism\" was a conservative state-building strategy designed to make ordinary Germans—not just the Junker elite—more loyal to throne and empire.
94	According to Kees van Kersbergen and Barbara Vis, his strategy was:granting social rights to enhance the integration of a hierarchical society, to forge a bond between workers and the state so as to strengthen the latter, to maintain traditional relations of authority between social and status groups, and to provide a countervailing power against the modernist forces of liberalism and socialism.
95	He created the modern welfare state in Germany in the 1880s and enacted universal male suffrage in the new German Empire in 1871.
96	He became a great hero to German conservatives, who erected many monuments to his memory and tried to emulate his policies.
97	Foreign policyBismarck's post-1871 foreign policy was conservative and sought to preserve the balance of power in Europe.
98	British historian Eric Hobsbawm concludes that he \"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [devoting] himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers\".
99	This was a departure from his adventurous foreign policy for Prussia, where he favored strength and expansion, punctuating this by saying \"The great question of the age are not settled by speeches and majority votes - this was the error of 1848-49 - but by iron and blood.\"
100	Bismarck's chief concern was that France would plot revenge after its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War.
101	As the French lacked the strength to defeat Germany by themselves, they sought an alliance with Russia, which would trap Germany between the two in a war (as would ultimately happen in 1914).
102	Bismarck wanted to prevent this at all costs and maintain friendly relations with the Russians, and thereby formed an alliance with them and Austria-Hungary, the Dreikaiserbund (League of Three Emperors) in 1881.
103	The alliance was further cemented by a separate non-aggression pact with Russia called Reinsurance Treaty, which was signed in 1887.
104	During this period, individuals within the German military were advocating a preemptive strike against Russia, but Bismarck knew that such ideas were foolhardy.
105	He once wrote that \"the most brilliant victories would not avail against the Russian nation, because of its climate, its desert, and its frugality, and having but one frontier to defend\", and because it would leave Germany with another bitter, resentful neighbour.
106	Meanwhile, the chancellor remained wary of any foreign policy developments that looked even remotely warlike.
107	In 1886, he moved to stop an attempted sale of horses to France on the grounds that they might be used for cavalry and also ordered an investigation into large Russian purchases of medicine from a German chemical works.
108	Bismarck stubbornly refused to listen to Georg Herbert zu Munster (ambassador to France), who reported back that the French were not seeking a revanchist war, and in fact were desperate for peace at all costs.
109	Bismarck and most of his contemporaries were conservative-minded and focused their foreign policy attention on Germany's neighbouring states.
110	In 1914, 60% of German foreign investment was in Europe, as opposed to just 5% of British investment.
111	Most of the money went to developing nations such as Russia that lacked the capital or technical knowledge to industrialize on their own.
112	The construction of the Baghdad Railway, financed by German banks, was designed to eventually connect Germany with the Turkish Empire and the Persian Gulf, but it also collided with British and Russian geopolitical interests.
113	Many consider Bismarck's foreign policy as a coherent system and partly responsible for the preservation of Europe's stability.
114	It was also marked by the need to balance circumspect defensiveness and the desire to be free from the constraints of its position as a major European power.
115	Unfortunately, Bismark's successors did not pursue his foreign policy legacy.
116	For instance, Kaiser Wilhelm II, who dismissed the chancellor in 1890, let the treaty with Russia lapse in favor of Germany's alliance with Austria, which finally led to a stronger coalition-building between Russia and France.
117	ColoniesA postage stamp from the Carolines Bismarck secured a number of German colonial possessions during the 1880s in Africa and the Pacific, but he never considered an overseas colonial empire valuable due to fierce resistance to German colonial rule from the natives.
118	Thus, Germany's colonies remained badly undeveloped.
119	However they excited the interest of the religious-minded, who supported an extensive network of missionaries.
120	Germans had dreamed of colonial imperialism since 1848.
121	Bismarck began the process, and by 1884 had acquired German New Guinea.
122	By the 1890s, German colonial expansion in Asia and the Pacific (Kiauchau in China, Tientsin in China, the Marianas, the Caroline Islands, Samoa) led to frictions with the UK, Russia, Japan, and the US.
123	The largest colonial enterprises were in Africa, where the Herero Wars in what is now Namibia in 1906–07 resulted in the Herero and Namaqua Genocide EconomyBy 1900, Germany became the largest economy in Europe and the second largest in the world behind the United States.
124	Previously, the United Kingdom held that spot.
125	Germany's main economic rivals were the United Kingdom and the United States.
126	Throughout its existence, it experienced economic growth and modernization led by heavy industry.
127	In 1871, it had a largely rural population of 41 million, while by 1913 this had increased to a predominantly urban population of 68 million.
128	Industrial powerFor 30 years, Germany struggled against Britain to be Europe's leading industrial power.
129	Representative of Germany's industry was the steel giant Krupp, whose first factory was built in Essen.
130	By 1902, the factory alone became \"A great city with its own streets, its own police force, fire department and traffic laws.
131	There are 150 kilometres of rail, 60 different factory buildings, 8,500 machine tools, seven electrical stations, 140 kilometres of underground cable and 46 overhead.
132	\"Under Bismarck, Germany was a world innovator in building the welfare state.
133	German workers enjoyed health, accident and maternity benefits, canteens, changing rooms and a national pension scheme.
134	RailwaysLacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways.
135	In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry.
136	However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth.
137	Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen.
138	By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and forged ahead of France.
139	The total length of German railroad tracks expanded from 21,000 kilometers in 1871 to 63,000 kilometres by 1913, establishing the largest rail network in the world after the United States, and effectively surpassing the 32,000 kilometers of rail that connected Britain in the same year.
140	IndustryKrupp Works in Essen, 1890 Industrialisation progressed dynamically in Germany, and German manufacturers began to capture domestic markets from British imports, and also to compete with British industry abroad, particularly in the U.S.
141	The German textile and metal industries had by 1870 surpassed those of Britain in organisation and technical efficiency and superseded British manufacturers in the domestic market.
142	Germany became the dominant economic power on the continent and was the second largest exporting nation after Britain.
143	Technological progress during German industrialisation occurred in four waves: the railway wave (1877–1886), the dye wave (1887–1896), the chemical wave (1897–1902), and the wave of electrical engineering (1903–1918).
144	Since Germany industrialised later than Britain, it was able to model its factories after those of Britain, thus making more efficient use of its capital and avoiding legacy methods in its leap to the envelope of technology.
145	Germany invested more heavily than the British in research, especially in chemistry, motors and electricity.
146	Germany's dominance in physics and chemistry was such that one-third of all Nobel Prizes went to German inventors and researchers.
147	The German cartel system (known as Konzerne), being significantly concentrated, was able to make more efficient use of capital.
148	Germany was not weighted down with an expensive worldwide empire that needed defense.
149	Following Germany's annexation of Alsace-Lorraine in 1871, it absorbed parts of what had been France's industrial base.
150	By 1900, the German chemical industry dominated the world market for synthetic dyes.
151	The three major firms BASF, Bayer and Hoechst produced several hundred different dyes, along with the five smaller firms.
152	In 1913, these eight firms produced almost 90% of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80% of their production abroad.
153	The three major firms had also integrated upstream into the production of essential raw materials and they began to expand into other areas of chemistry such as pharmaceuticals, photographic film, agricultural chemicals and electrochemicals.
154	Top-level decision-making was in the hands of professional salaried managers; leading Chandler to call the German dye companies \"the world's first truly managerial industrial enterprises\".
155	There were many spinoffs from research—such as the pharmaceutical industry, which emerged from chemical research.
156	By the start of World War I (1914–1918), German industry switched to war production.
157	The heaviest demands were on coal and steel for artillery and shell production, and on chemicals for the synthesis of materials that were subject to import restrictions and for chemical weapons and war supplies.
158	ConsolidationThe creation of the Empire under Prussian leadership was a victory for the concept of Kleindeutschland (Smaller Germany) over the Großdeutschland concept.
159	This meant that Austria-Hungary, a multi-ethnic Empire with a considerable German-speaking population, would remain outside of the German nation state.
160	Bismarck's policy was to pursue a solution diplomatically.
161	The effective alliance between Germany and Austria played a major role in Germany's decision to enter World War I in 1914.
162	Bismarck announced there would be no more territorial additions to Germany in Europe, and his diplomacy after 1871 was focused on stabilizing the European system and preventing any wars.
163	He succeeded, and only after his ouster in 1890 did the diplomatic tensions start rising again.
164	Social issuesAfter achieving formal unification in 1871, Bismarck devoted much of his attention to the cause of national unity.
165	He opposed conservative Catholic activism and emancipation, especially the powers of the Vatican under Pope Pius IX, and working class radicalism, represented by the emerging Social Democratic Party.
166	KulturkampfTensions between Germany and the Catholic Church hierarchy are depicted in a chess game between Bismarck and Pope Pius IX.
167	Between Berlin and Rome, Kladderadatsch, 1875.
168	Prussia in 1871 included 16,000,000 Protestants, both Reformed and Lutheran, and 8,000,000 Catholics.
169	Most people were generally segregated into their own religious worlds, living in rural districts or city neighbourhoods that were overwhelmingly of the same religion, and sending their children to separate public schools where their religion was taught.
170	There was little interaction or intermarriage.
171	On the whole, the Protestants had a higher social status, and the Catholics were more likely to be peasant farmers or unskilled or semiskilled industrial workers.
172	In 1870, the Catholics formed their own political party, the Centre Party, which generally supported unification and most of Bismarck's policies.
173	However, Bismarck distrusted parliamentary democracy in general and opposition parties in particular, especially when the Centre Party showed signs of gaining support among dissident elements such as the Polish Catholics in Silesia.
174	A powerful intellectual force of the time was anti-Catholicism, led by the liberal intellectuals who formed a vital part of Bismarck's coalition.
175	They saw the Catholic Church as a powerful force of reaction and anti-modernity, especially after the proclamation of papal infallibility in 1870, and the tightening control of the Vatican over the local bishops.
176	The Kulturkampf launched by Bismarck 1871–1880 affected Prussia; although there were similar movements in Baden and Hesse, the rest of Germany was not affected.
177	According to the new imperial constitution, the states were in charge of religious and educational affairs; they funded the Protestant and Catholic schools.
178	In July 1871 Bismarck abolished the Catholic section of the Prussian Ministry of ecclesiastical and educational affairs, depriving Catholics of their voice at the highest level.
179	The system of strict government supervision of schools was applied only in Catholic areas; the Protestant schools were left alone.
180	Much more serious were the May laws of 1873.
181	One made the appointment of any priest dependent on his attendance at a German university, as opposed to the seminaries that the Catholics typically used.
182	Furthermore, all candidates for the ministry had to pass an examination in German culture before a state board which weeded out intransigent Catholics.
183	Another provision gave the government a veto power over most church activities.
184	A second law abolished the jurisdiction of the Vatican over the Catholic Church in Prussia; its authority was transferred to a government body controlled by Protestants.
185	Nearly all German bishops, clergy, and laymen rejected the legality of the new laws, and were defiant in the face of heavier and heavier penalties and imprisonments imposed by Bismarck's government.
186	By 1876, all the Prussian bishops were imprisoned or in exile, and a third of the Catholic parishes were without a priest.
187	In the face of systematic defiance, the Bismarck government increased the penalties and its attacks, and were challenged in 1875 when a papal encyclical declared the whole ecclesiastical legislation of Prussia was invalid, and threatened to excommunicate any Catholic who obeyed.
188	There was no violence, but the Catholics mobilized their support, set up numerous civic organizations, raised money to pay fines, and rallied behind their church and the Centre Party.
189	The \"Old Catholic Church\", which rejected the First Vatican Council, attracted only a few thousand members.
190	Bismarck, a devout pietistic Protestant, realized his Kulturkampf was backfiring when secular and socialist elements used the opportunity to attack all religion.
191	In the long run, the most significant result was the mobilization of the Catholic voters, and their insistence on protecting their religious identity.
192	In the elections of 1874, the Centre party doubled its popular vote, and became the second-largest party in the national parliament—and remained a powerful force for the next 60 years, so that after Bismarck it became difficult to form a government without their support.
193	Social reformBismarck built on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as in the 1840s.
194	In the 1880s he introduced old-age pensions, accident insurance, medical care and unemployment insurance that formed the basis of the modern European welfare state.
195	He came to realize that this sort of policy was very appealing, since it bound workers to the state, and also fit in very well with his authoritarian nature.
196	The social security systems installed by Bismarck (health care in 1883, accident insurance in 1884, invalidity and old-age insurance in 1889) at the time were the largest in the world and, to a degree, still exist in Germany today.
197	Bismarck's paternalistic programs won the support of German industry because its goals were to win the support of the working classes for the Empire and reduce the outflow of immigrants to America, where wages were higher but welfare did not exist.
198	Bismarck further won the support of both industry and skilled workers by his high tariff policies, which protected profits and wages from American competition, although they alienated the liberal intellectuals who wanted free trade.
199	GermanisationOne of the effects of the unification policies was the gradually increasing tendency to eliminate the use of non-German languages in public life, schools and academic settings with the intent of pressuring the non-German population to abandon their national identity in what was called \"Germanisation\".
200	These policies often had the reverse effect of stimulating resistance, usually in the form of home schooling and tighter unity in the minority groups, especially the Poles.
201	The Germanisation policies were targeted particularly against the significant Polish minority of the empire, gained by Prussia in the partitions of Poland.
202	Poles were treated as an ethnic minority even where they made up the majority, as in the Province of Posen, where a series of anti-Polish measures was enforced.
203	Numerous anti-Polish laws had no great effect especially in the province of Posen where the German-speaking population dropped from 42.8% in 1871 to 38.1% in 1905, despite all efforts.
204	AntisemitismAntisemitism was endemic in Germany during the period.
205	Before Napoleon's decrees ended the ghettos in Germany, it had been religiously motivated, but by the 19th century, it was a factor in German nationalism.
206	The last legal barriers on Jews in Prussia were lifted by the 1860s, and within 20 years, they were over-represented in the white-collar professions and much of academia.
207	In the popular mind Jews became a symbol of capitalism and wealth.
208	On the other hand, the constitution and legal system protected the rights of Jews as German citizens.
209	Antisemitic parties were formed but soon collapsed.
210	LawBismarck's efforts also initiated the levelling of the enormous differences between the German states, which had been independent in their evolution for centuries, especially with legislation.
211	The completely different legal histories and judicial systems posed enormous complications, especially for national trade.
212	While a common trade code had already been introduced by the Confederation in 1861 (which was adapted for the Empire and, with great modifications, is still in effect today), there was little similarity in laws otherwise.
213	In 1871, a common Criminal Code (Reichsstrafgesetzbuch) was introduced; in 1877, common court procedures were established in the court system (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz), civil procedures (Zivilprozessordnung) and criminal procedures (Strafprozessordnung).
214	In 1873 the constitution was amended to allow the Empire to replace the various and greatly differing Civil Codes of the states (If they existed at all; for example, parts of Germany formerly occupied by Napoleon's France had adopted the French Civil Code, while in Prussia the Allgemeines Preußisches Landrecht of 1794 was still in effect).
215	In 1881, a first commission was established to produce a common Civil Code for all of the Empire, an enormous effort that would produce the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB), possibly one of the most impressive legal works in the world; it was eventually put into effect on 1 January 1900.
216	All of these codifications are, albeit with many amendments, still in effect today.
217	Year of three emperorsFrederick III, emperor for only 99 days (9 March15 June 1888).
218	On 9 March 1888, Wilhelm I died shortly before his 91st birthday, leaving his son Frederick III as the new emperor.
219	Frederick was a liberal and an admirer of the British constitution, while his links to Britain strengthened further with his marriage to Princess Victoria, eldest child of Queen Victoria.
220	With his ascent to the throne, many hoped that Frederick's reign would lead to a liberalisation of the Reich and an increase of parliament's influence on the political process.
221	The dismissal of Robert von Puttkamer, the highly-conservative Prussian interior minister, on 8 June was a sign of the expected direction and a blow to Bismarck's administration.
222	By the time of his accession, however, Frederick had developed incurable laryngeal cancer, which had been diagnosed in 1887.
223	He died on the 99th day of his rule, on 15 June 1888.
224	His son Wilhelm II became emperor.

226	Oil painting by Max Koner, 1890.
227	Wilhelm II wanted to reassert his ruling prerogatives at a time when other monarchs in Europe were being transformed into constitutional figureheads.
228	This decision led the ambitious Kaiser into conflict with Bismarck.
229	The old chancellor had hoped to guide Wilhelm as he had guided his grandfather, but the emperor wanted to be the master in his own house and had many sycophants telling him that Frederick the Great would not have been great with a Bismarck at his side.
230	A key difference between Wilhelm II and Bismarck was their approaches to handling political crises, especially in 1889, when German coal miners went on strike in Upper Silesia.
231	Bismarck demanded that the German Army be sent in to crush the strike, but Wilhelm II rejected this authoritarian measure, responding \"I do not wish to stain my reign with the blood of my subjects.\"
232	Instead of condoning repression, Wilhelm had the government negotiate with a delegation from the coal miners, which brought the strike to an end without violence.
233	The fractious relationship ended in March 1890, after Wilhelm II and Bismarck quarrelled, and the chancellor resigned days later.
234	Bismarck's last few years had seen power slip from his hands as he grew older, more irritable, more authoritarian, and less focused.
235	With Bismarck's departure, Wilhelm II became the dominant ruler of Germany.
236	Unlike his grandfather, Wilhelm I, who had been largely content to leave government affairs to the chancellor, Wilhelm II wanted to be fully informed and actively involved in running Germany, not an ornamental figurehead, although most Germans found his claims of divine right to rule amusing.
237	Wilhelm allowed politician Walther Rathenau to tutor him in European economics and industrial and financial realities in Europe.
238	As Hull (2004) notes, Bismarckian foreign policy \"was too sedate for the reckless Kaiser\".
239	Wilhelm became internationally notorious for his aggressive stance on foreign policy and his strategic blunders (such as the Tangier Crisis), which pushed the German Empire into growing political isolation and eventually helped to cause World War I.Domestic affairsThe Reichstag in the 1890s\\early 1900s.
240	Under Wilhelm II, Germany no longer had long-ruling strong chancellors like Bismarck.
241	The new chancellors had difficulty in performing their roles, especially the additional role as Prime Minister of Prussia assigned to them in the German Constitution.
242	The reforms of Chancellor Leo von Caprivi, which liberalized trade and so reduced unemployment, were supported by the Kaiser and most Germans except for Prussian landowners, who feared loss of land and power and launched several campaigns against the reforms.
243	While Prussian aristocrats challenged the demands of a united German state, in the 1890s several organizations were set up to challenge the authoritarian conservative Prussian militarism which was being imposed on the country.
244	Educators opposed to the German state-run schools, which emphasized military education, set up their own independent liberal schools, which encouraged individuality and freedom.
245	However nearly all the schools in Imperial Germany had a very high standard and kept abreast with modern developments in knowledge.
246	Artists began experimental art in opposition to Kaiser Wilhelm's support for traditional art, to which Wilhelm responded \"art which transgresses the laws and limits laid down by me can no longer be called art\".
247	It was largely thanks to Wilhelm's influence that most printed material in Germany used blackletter instead of the Roman type used in the rest of Western Europe.
248	At the same time, a new generation of cultural creators emerged.
249	Berlin in the late 19th century From the 1890s onwards, the most effective opposition to the monarchy came from the newly formed Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), whose radicals advocated Marxism.
250	The threat of the SPD to the German monarchy and industrialists caused the state both to crack down on the party's supporters and to implement its own programme of social reform to soothe discontent.
251	Germany's large industries provided significant social welfare programmes and good care to their employees, as long as they were not identified as socialists or trade-union members.
252	The larger industrial firms provided pensions, sickness benefits and even housing to their employees.
253	Having learned from the failure of Bismarck's Kulturkampf, Wilhelm II maintained good relations with the Roman Catholic Church and concentrated on opposing socialism.
254	This policy failed when the Social Democrats won a third of the votes in the 1912 elections to the Reichstag, and became the largest political party in Germany.
255	The government remained in the hands of a succession of conservative coalitions supported by right-wing liberals or Catholic clerics and heavily dependent on the Kaiser's favour.
256	The rising militarism under Wilhelm II caused many Germans to emigrate to the U.S. and the British colonies to escape mandatory military service.
257	During World War I, the Kaiser increasingly devolved his powers to the leaders of the German High Command, particularly future President of Germany, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff.
258	Hindenburg took over the role of commander–in–chief from the Kaiser, while Ludendorff became de facto general chief of staff.
259	By 1916, Germany was effectively a military dictatorship run by Hindenburg and Ludendorff, with the Kaiser reduced to a mere figurehead.
260	Foreign affairsBismarck at the Berlin Conference, 1884 Wilhelm II wanted Germany to have her \"place in the sun\", like Britain, which he constantly wished to emulate or rival.
261	With German traders and merchants already active worldwide, he encouraged colonial efforts in Africa and the Pacific (\"new imperialism\"), causing the German Empire to vie with other European powers for remaining \"unclaimed\" territories.
262	With the encouragement or at least the acquiescence of Britain, which at this stage saw Germany as a counterweight to her old rival France, Germany acquired German Southwest Africa (modern Namibia), German Kamerun (modern Cameroon), Togoland (modern Togo) and German East Africa (modern Rwanda, Burundi, and the mainland part of current Tanzania).
263	Islands were gained in the Pacific through purchase and treaties and also a 99-year lease for the territory of Kiautschou in northeast China.
264	But of these German colonies only Togoland and German Samoa (after 1908) became self-sufficient and profitable; all the others required subsidies from the Berlin treasury for building infrastructure, school systems, hospitals and other institutions.
265	German colonial flag Bismarck had originally dismissed the agitation for colonies with contempt; he favoured a Eurocentric foreign policy, as the treaty arrangements made during his tenure in office show.
266	As a latecomer to colonization, Germany repeatedly came into conflict with the established colonial powers and also with the United States, which opposed German attempts at colonial expansion in both the Caribbean and the Pacific.
267	Native insurrections in German territories received prominent coverage in other countries, especially in Britain; the established powers had dealt with such uprisings decades earlier, often brutally, and had secured firm control of their colonies by then.
268	The Boxer Rising in China, which the Chinese government eventually sponsored, began in the Shandong province, in part because Germany, as colonizer at Kiautschou, was an untested power and had only been active there for two years.
269	Eight western nations, including the United States, mounted a joint relief force to rescue westerners caught up in the rebellion.
270	During the departure ceremonies for the German contingent, Wilhelm II urged them to behave like the Hun invaders of continental Europe – an unfortunate remark that would later be resurrected by British propagandists to paint Germans as barbarians during World War I and World War II.
271	On two occasions, a French-German conflict over the fate of Morocco seemed inevitable.
272	Hoisting the German flag at Mioko, German New Guinea in 1884 Upon acquiring Southwest Africa, German settlers were encouraged to cultivate land held by the Herero and Nama.
273	Herero and Nama tribal lands were used for a variety of exploitative goals (much as the British did before in Rhodesia), including farming, ranching, and mining for minerals and diamonds.
274	In 1904, the Herero and the Nama revolted against the colonists in Southwest Africa, killing farm families, their laborers and servants.
275	In response to the attacks, troops were dispatched to quell the uprising which then resulted in the Herero and Namaqua Genocide.
276	In total, some 65,000 Herero (80% of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Nama (50% of the total Nama population) perished.
277	The commander of the punitive expedition, General Lothar von Trotha, was eventually relieved and reprimanded for his usurpation of orders and the cruelties he inflicted.
278	These occurrences were sometimes referred to as \"the first genocide of the 20th century\" and officially condemned by the United Nations in 1985.
279	In 2004 a formal apology by a government minister of the Federal Republic of Germany followed.
280	Middle EastBismarck and Wilhelm II after him sought closer economic ties with the Ottoman Empire.
281	Under Wilhelm II, with the financial backing of the Deutsche Bank, the Baghdad Railway was begun in 1900, although by 1914 it was still  short of its destination in Baghdad.
282	In an interview with Wilhelm in 1899, Cecil Rhodes had tried \"to convince the Kaiser that the future of the German empire abroad lay in the Middle East\" and not in Africa; with a grand Middle-Eastern empire, Germany could afford to allow Britain the unhindered completion of the Cape-to-Cairo railway that Rhodes favoured.
283	Britain initially supported the Baghdad Railway; but by 1911 British statesmen came to fear it might be extended to Basra on the Persian Gulf, threatening Britain's naval supremacy in the Indian Ocean.
284	Accordingly, they asked to have construction halted, to which Germany and the Ottoman Empire acquiesced.
285	EuropeWilhelm II and his advisers committed a fatal diplomatic error when they allowed the \"Reinsurance Treaty\" that Bismarck had negotiated with Tsarist Russia to lapse.
286	Germany was left with no firm ally but Austria-Hungary, and her support for action in annexing Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908 further soured relations with Russia.
287	Wilhelm missed the opportunity to secure an alliance with Britain in the 1890s when it was involved in colonial rivalries with France, and he alienated British statesmen further by openly supporting the Boers in the South African War and building a navy to rival Britain's.
288	By 1911 Wilhelm had completely picked apart the careful power balance established by Bismarck and Britain turned to France in the Entente Cordiale.
289	Germany's only other ally besides Austria was the Kingdom of Italy, but it remained an ally only pro forma.
290	When war came, Italy saw more benefit in an alliance with Britain, France, and Russia, which, in the secret Treaty of London in 1915 promised it the frontier districts of Austria where Italians formed the majority of the population and also colonial concessions.
291	Germany did acquire a second ally that same year when the Ottoman Empire entered the war on its side, but in the long run supporting the Ottoman war effort only drained away German resources from the main fronts.
292	World War IOriginsMap of the world showing the participants in World War I.
293	Those fighting on the Entente's side (at one point or another) are depicted in green, the Central Powers in orange, and neutral countries in grey.
294	Following the assassination of the Austro-Hungarian Archduke of  Franz Ferdinand by  a Bosnian Serb, the Kaiser offered Emperor Franz Joseph full support for Austro-Hungarian plans to invade the Kingdom of Serbia, which Austria-Hungary blamed for the assassination.
295	This unconditional support for Austria-Hungary was called a \"blank cheque\" by historians, including German Fritz Fischer.
296	Subsequent interpretation – for example at the Versailles Peace Conference – was that this \"blank cheque\" licensed Austro-Hungarian aggression regardless of the diplomatic consequences, and thus Germany bore responsibility for starting the war, or at least provoking a wider conflict.
297	Germany began the war by targeting its chief rival, France.
298	Germany saw France as its principal danger on the European continent as it could mobilize much faster than Russia and bordered Germany's industrial core in the Rhineland.
299	Unlike Britain and Russia, the French entered the war mainly for revenge against Germany, in particular for France's loss of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany in 1871.
300	The German high command knew that France would muster its forces to go into Alsace-Lorraine.
301	Aside from the very unofficial Septemberprogramm, the Germans never stated a clear list of goals that they wanted out of the war.
302	Western FrontThe mobilization in 1914 Germany did not want to risk lengthy battles along the Franco-German border and instead adopted the Schlieffen Plan, a military strategy designed to cripple France by invading Belgium and Luxembourg, sweeping down to encircle and crush both Paris and the French forces along the Franco-German border in a quick victory.
303	After defeating France, Germany would turn to attack Russia.
304	The plan required violating the official neutrality of Belgium and Luxembourg, which Britain had guaranteed by treaty.
305	However, the Germans had calculated that Britain would enter the war regardless of whether they had formal justification to do so.
306	At first the attack was successful: the German Army swept down from Belgium and Luxembourg and advanced on Paris, at the nearby River Marne.
307	However, the evolution of weapons over the last century heavily favored defense over offense, especially thanks to the machine gun, so that it took proportionally more offensive force to overcome a defensive position.
308	This resulted in the German lines on the offense contracting to keep up the offensive time table while correspondingly the French lines were extending.
309	In addition, some German units that were originally slotted for the German far right were transferred to the Eastern Front in reaction to Russia mobilizing far faster than anticipated.
310	The combined affect had the German right flank sweeping down in front of Paris instead of behind it exposing the German Right flank to the extending French lines and attack from strategic French reserves stationed in Paris.
311	Attacking the exposed German right flank, the French Army and the British Army put up a strong resistance to the defense of Paris at the First Battle of the Marne, resulting in the German Army retreating.
312	The aftermath of the First Battle of the Marne was a long-held stalemate between the German Army and the Allies in dug-in trench warfare.
313	Further German attempts to break through deeper into France failed at the two battles of Ypres (1st/2nd) with huge casualties.
314	German Chief of Staff Erich von Falkenhayn decided to break away from the Schlieffen Plan and instead focus on a war of attrition against France.
315	Falkenhayn targeted the ancient city of Verdun because it had been one of the last cities to hold out against the German Army in 1870, and Falkenhayn knew that as a matter of national pride the French would do anything to ensure that it was not taken.
316	He expected that with proper tactics, French losses would be greater than those of the Germans and that continued French commitment of troops to Verdun would \"bleed the French Army white\" and then allow the German army to take France easily.
317	In 1916, the Battle of Verdun began, with the French positions under constant shelling and poison gas attack and taking large casualties under the assault of overwhelmingly large German forces.
318	However, Falkenhayn's prediction of a greater ratio of French killed proved to be wrong.
319	Falkenhayn was replaced by Erich Ludendorff, and with no success in sight, the German Army pulled out of Verdun in December 1916 and the battle ended.
320	Eastern FrontFront line at the time of cease-fire and at the time of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk While the Western Front was a stalemate for the German Army, the Eastern Front eventually proved to be a great success.
321	Despite initial setbacks due to the unexpectedly rapid mobilisation of the Russian army, which resulted in a Russian invasion of East Prussia and Austrian Galicia, the badly organised and supplied Russian Army faltered and the German and Austro-Hungarian armies thereafter steadily advanced eastward.
322	The Germans benefited from political instability in Russia and its population's desire to end the war.
323	In 1917 the German government allowed Russia's communist Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin to travel through Germany from Switzerland into Russia.
324	Germany believed that if Lenin could create further political unrest, Russia would no longer be able to continue its war with Germany, allowing the German Army to focus on the Western Front.
325	In March 1917, the Tsar was ousted from the Russian throne, and in November a Bolshevik government came to power under the leadership of Lenin.
326	Facing political opposition from the Bolsheviks, he decided to end Russia's campaign against Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria in order to redirect Bolshevik energy to eliminating internal dissent.
327	In March 1918, by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Bolshevik government gave Germany and the Ottoman Empire enormous territorial and economic concessions in exchange for an end to war on the Eastern Front.
328	All of the modern-day Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) were given over to the German occupation authority Ober Ost, along with Belarus and Ukraine.
329	Thus Germany had at last achieved its long-wanted dominance of \"Mitteleuropa\" (Central Europe) and could now focus fully on defeating the Allies on the Western Front.
330	In practice, however, the forces that were needed to garrison and secure the new territories were a drain on the German war effort.
331	ColoniesGermany quickly lost almost all its colonies.
332	However, in German East Africa, an impressive guerrilla campaign was waged by the colonial army leader there, General Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck.
333	Using Germans and native Askaris, Lettow-Vorbeck launched multiple guerrilla raids against British forces in Kenya and Rhodesia.
334	He also invaded Portuguese Mozambique to gain his forces supplies and to pick up more Askari recruits.
335	His force was still active at war's end.
336	1918
337	Defeating Russia in 1917 enabled Germany to transfer hundreds of thousands of combat troops from the east to the Western Front, giving it a numerical advantage over the Allies.
338	By retraining the soldiers in new stormtrooper tactics, the Germans expected to unfreeze the battlefield and win a decisive victory before the army of the United States, which had now entered the war on the side of Britain and France, arrived in strength.
339	However, the repeated German offensives in the spring of 1918 all failed, as the Allies fell back and regrouped and the Germans lacked the reserves needed to consolidate their gains.
340	Meanwhile, soldiers had become radicalised by the Russian Revolution and were less willing to continue fighting.
341	The war effort sparked civil unrest in Germany, while the troops, who had been constantly in the field without relief, grew exhausted and lost all hope of victory.
342	In the summer of 1918, with the Americans arriving at the rate of 10,000 a day and the German reserves spent, it was only a matter of time before multiple Allied offensives destroyed the German army.
343	Home frontA memorial to soldiers killed in World War I The concept of \"total war\" meant that supplies had to be redirected towards the armed forces and, with German commerce being stopped by the Allied naval blockade, German civilians were forced to live in increasingly meagre conditions.
344	First food prices were controlled, then rationing was introduced.
345	During the war about 750,000 German civilians died from malnutrition.
346	Towards the end of the war conditions deteriorated rapidly on the home front, with severe food shortages reported in all urban areas.
347	The causes included the transfer of many farmers and food workers into the military, combined with the overburdened railway system, shortages of coal, and the British blockade.
348	The winter of 1916–1917 was known as the \"turnip winter\", because the people had to survive on a vegetable more commonly reserved for livestock, as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce.
349	Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves.
350	Even the army had to cut the soldiers' rations.
351	The morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink.
352	Revolt and demiseMany Germans wanted an end to the war and increasing numbers began to associate with the political left, such as the Social Democratic Party and the more radical Independent Social Democratic Party, which demanded an end to the war.
353	The entry of the U.S. into the war in April 1917 changed the long-run balance of power in favour of the Allies.
354	The end of October 1918, in Kiel, in northern Germany, saw the beginning of the German Revolution of 1918–1919.
355	Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war which they saw as good as lost, initiating the uprising.
356	On 3 November, the revolt spread to other cities and states of the country, in many of which workers' and soldiers' councils were established.
357	Meanwhile, Hindenburg and the senior generals lost confidence in the Kaiser and his government.
358	Bulgaria signed the Armistice of Solun on 29 September 1918.
359	The Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918.
360	Between 24 October and 3 November 1918, Italy defeated Austria-Hungary in the battle of Vittorio Veneto, which forced Austria-Hungary to sign the Armistice of Villa Giusti on 3 November 1918.
361	So, in November 1918, with internal revolution, the Allies advancing toward Germany on the Western Front, Austria-Hungary falling apart from multiple ethnic tensions, its other allies out of the war and pressure from the German high command, the Kaiser and all German ruling princes abdicated.
362	On 9 November, the Social Democrat Philipp Scheidemann proclaimed a republic.
363	The new government led by the German Social Democrats called for and received an armistice on 11 November.
364	It was succeeded by the Weimar Republic.
365	Those opposed, including disaffected veterans, joined a diverse set of paramilitary and underground political groups such as the Freikorps, the Organisation Consul, and the Communists.
366	ConstitutionThe Empire's legislation was based on two organs, the Bundesrat and the Reichstag (parliament).
367	There was universal male suffrage for the Reichstag, however legislation would have to pass both houses.
368	The Bundesrat contained representatives of the states.
369	Constituent statesCoat of arms and flags of the constituent states in the year 1900 Before unification, German territory (excluding Austria and Switzerland) was made up of 27 constituent states.
370	These states consisted of kingdoms, grand duchies, duchies, principalities, free Hanseatic cities and one imperial territory.
371	The free cities had a republican form of government on the state level, even though the Empire at large was constituted as a monarchy, and so were most of the states.
372	The Kingdom of Prussia was the largest of the constituent states, covering two-thirds of the empire's territory.
373	Several of these states had gained sovereignty following the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, and had been de facto sovereign from the mid-1600s onward.
374	Others were created as sovereign states after the Congress of Vienna in 1815.
375	Territories were not necessarily contiguous—many existed in several parts, as a result of historical acquisitions, or, in several cases, divisions of the ruling families.
376	Some of the initially existing states, in particular Hanover, were abolished and annexed by Prussia as a result of the war of 1866.
377	Each component of the German Empire sent representatives to the Federal Council (Bundesrat) and, via single-member districts, the Imperial Diet (Reichstag).
378	Relations between the Imperial centre and the Empire's components were somewhat fluid and were developed on an ongoing basis.
379	The extent to which the Emperor could, for example, intervene on occasions of disputed or unclear succession was much debated on occasion—for example in the inheritance crisis of the Lippe-Detmold.

382	The non-German Germanic languages (0.5%), like Danish, Dutch and Frisian, were located in the north and northwest of the empire, near the borders with Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.
383	Low German was spoken throughout northern Germany and, though linguistically as distinct from High German (Hochdeutsch) as from Dutch and English, is considered \"German\", hence also its name.
384	Danish and Frisian were spoken predominantly in the north of the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein and Dutch in the western border areas of Prussia (Hanover, Westphalia, and the Rhine Province).
385	Polish and other Slavic languages (6.28%) were spoken chiefly in the east.
386	A few (0.5%) spoke French, especially in the Reichsland Elsass-Lothringen, where French-speakers formed 11.6% of the total population.

389	Generally, religious demographics of the early modern period hardly changed.
390	Still, there were almost entirely Catholic areas (Lower and Upper Bavaria, northern Westphalia, Upper Silesia, etc.) and almost entirely Protestant areas (Schleswig-Holstein, Pomerania, Saxony, etc.).
391	Confessional prejudices, especially towards mixed marriages, were still common.
392	Bit by bit, through internal migration, religious blending was more and more common.
393	In eastern territories, confession was almost uniquely perceived to be connected to one's ethnicity and the equation \"Protestant =
394	German, Catholic = Polish\" was held to be valid.
395	In areas affected by immigration in the Ruhr area and Westphalia, as well as in some large cities, religious landscape changed substantially.
396	This was especially true in largely Catholic areas of Westphalia, which changed through Protestant immigration from the eastern provinces.
397	Politically, the confessional division of Germany had considerable consequences.
398	In Catholic areas, the Centre Party had a big electorate.
399	On the other hand, Social Democrats and Free Trade Unions usually received hardly any votes in the Catholic areas of the Ruhr.
400	This began to change with the secularization arising in the last decades of the German Empire.

402	Conservatives, liberals, socialists, nationalists, Catholics and Protestants all had their own interpretations, which led to a fractious political and social climate in Germany in the aftermath of the empire's collapse.
403	War flag of the German Empire.
404	In 1956, the Iron Cross was re-introduced as the symbol of the Bundeswehr, the modern German armed forces.
405	Under Bismarck, a united German state had finally been achieved, but it remained a Prussian-dominated state and did not include German Austria as Pan-German nationalists had desired.
406	The influence of Prussian militarism, the Empire's colonial efforts and its vigorous, competitive industrial prowess all gained it the dislike and envy of other nations.
407	The German Empire enacted a number of progressive reforms, such as Europe's first social welfare system and freedom of press.
408	There was also a modern system for electing the federal parliament, the Reichstag, in which every adult man had one vote.
409	This enabled the Socialists and the Catholic Centre Party to play considerable roles in the empire's political life despite the continued hostility of Prussian aristocrats.
410	The era of the German Empire is well remembered in Germany as one of great cultural and intellectual vigour.
411	Thomas Mann published his novel Buddenbrooks in 1901.
412	Theodor Mommsen received the Nobel prize for literature a year later for his Roman history.
413	Painters like the groups Der Blaue Reiter and Die Brücke made a significant contribution to modern art.
414	The AEG turbine factory in Berlin by Peter Behrens from 1909 can be regarded as a milestone in classic modern architecture and an outstanding example of emerging functionalism.
415	The social, economic, and scientific successes of this Gründerzeit, or founding epoch, have sometimes led the Wilhelmine era to be regarded as a golden age.
416	In the field of economics, the \"Kaiserzeit\" laid the foundation of Germany's status as one of the world's leading economic powers.
417	The iron and coal industries of the Ruhr, the Saar and Upper Silesia especially contributed to that process.
418	The first motorcar was built by Karl Benz in 1886.
419	The enormous growth of industrial production and industrial potential also led to a rapid urbanisation of Germany, which turned the Germans into a nation of city dwellers.
420	More than 5 million people left Germany for the United States during the 19th century.
421	SonderwegMany historians have emphasized the central importance of a German Sonderweg or \"special path\" (or \"exceptionalism\") as the root of Nazism and the German catastrophe in the 20th century.
422	According to the historiography by Kocka (1988), the process of nation-building from above had very grievous long-term implications.
423	In terms of parliamentary democracy, Parliament was kept weak, the parties were fragmented, and there was a high level of mutual distrust.
424	The Nazis built on the illiberal, anti-pluralist elements of Weimar's political culture.
425	The Junker elites (the large landowners in the east) and senior civil servants used their great power and influence well into the twentieth century to frustrate any movement toward democracy.
426	They played an especially negative role in the crisis of 1930–1933.
427	Bismarck's emphasis on military force amplified the voice of the officer corps, which combined advanced modernisation of military technology with reactionary politics.
428	The rising upper-middle class elites, in the business, financial and professional worlds, tended to accept the values of the old traditional elites.
429	The German Empire was for Hans-Ulrich Wehler a strange mixture of highly successful capitalist industrialisation and socio-economic modernisation on the one hand, and of surviving pre-industrial institutions, power relations and traditional cultures on the other.
430	Wehler argues that it produced a high degree of internal tension, which led on the one hand to the suppression of socialists, Catholics and reformers, and on the other hand to a highly aggressive foreign policy.
431	For these reasons Fritz Fischer and his students emphasised Germany's primary guilt for causing the First World War.
432	Hans-Ulrich Wehler, a leader of the Bielefeld School of social history, places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s–1870s, when economic modernisation took place, but political modernisation did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service.
433	Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernising society.
434	Recognising the importance of modernising forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus).
435	The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernisation of its political structures.
436	At the core of Wehler's interpretation is his treatment of \"the middle class\" and \"revolution\", each of which was instrumental in shaping the 20th century.
437	Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of \"charismatic domination\", which focuses heavily on Adolf Hitler.
438	The historiographical concept of a German Sonderweg has had a turbulent history.
439	19th century scholars who emphasised a separate German path to modernity saw it as a positive factor that differentiated Germany from the \"western path\" typified by Great Britain.
440	They stressed the strong bureaucratic state, reforms initiated by Bismarck and other strong leaders, the Prussian service ethos, the high culture of philosophy and music, and Germany's pioneering of a social welfare state.
441	In the 1950s, historians in West Germany argued that the Sonderweg led Germany to the disaster of 1933–1945.
442	The special circumstances of German historical structures and experiences, were interpreted as preconditions that, while not directly causing National Socialism, did hamper the development of a liberal democracy and facilitate the rise of fascism.
443	The Sonderweg paradigm has provided the impetus for at least three strands of research in German historiography: the \"long 19th century\", the history of the bourgeoisie, and comparisons with the West.
444	After 1990, increased attention to cultural dimensions and to comparative and relational history moved German historiography to different topics, with much less attention paid to the Sonderweg.
445	While some historians have abandoned the Sonderweg thesis, they have not provided a generally accepted alternative interpretation.
446	Territorial legacy
447	In addition to present-day Germany, large parts of what comprised the German Empire now belong to several other modern European countries.

552	With roots in blues rock, psychedelic rock, and acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness.
553	The genre's lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.
554	In 1968, three of the genre's most famous pioneers, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple were founded.
555	Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics.
556	During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed.
557	Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein.
558	Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"metalheads\" or \"headbangers\".
559	During the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as Mötley Crüe, Poison and Def Leppard.
560	Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of heavy metal such as death metal (with bands such as Death, Possessed, and Obituary) and black metal (with bands such as Mayhem, Bathory, and Immortal) remain subcultural phenomena.
561	Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre.
562	These include groove metal (with bands such as Pantera, Sepultura, and Lamb of God) and nu metal (with bands such as Korn, Slipknot, and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop.
563	CharacteristicsHeavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound, and vigorous vocals.
564	Heavy metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter, or omit one or more of these attributes.
565	The New York Times critic Jon Pareles writes, \"In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rock—the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force.\"
566	The typical band lineup includes a drummer, a bassist, a rhythm guitarist, a lead guitarist, and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist.
567	Keyboard instruments are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound.
568	Deep Purple's Jon Lord played an overdriven Hammond organ.
569	In 1970, John Paul Jones used a Moog synthesizer on Led Zeppelin III; by the 1990s, in \"almost every subgenre of heavy metal\" synthesizers were used.
570	Judas Priest, performing in 2005.
571	The electric guitar and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal.
572	The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy distortion.
573	For classic heavy metal guitar tone, guitarists maintain moderate levels gain at moderate levels, without excessive preamp or pedal distortion, to retain open spaces and air in the music; the guitar amplifier is turned up loud to produce the characteristic \"punch and grind\".
574	Thrash metal guitar tone has scooped mid-frequencies and tightly compressed sound with lots of bass frequencies.
575	Guitar solos are \"an essential element of the heavy metal code ... that underscores the significance of the guitar\" to the genre.
576	Most heavy metal songs \"feature at least one guitar solo\", which is \"a primary means through which the heavy metal performer expresses virtuosity\".
577	Some exceptions are nu metal and grindcore bands, which tend to omit guitar solos.
578	With rhythm guitar parts, the \"heavy crunch sound in heavy metal ...
579	[is created by] palm muting\" the strings with the picking hand and using distortion.
580	Palm muting creates a tighter, more precise sound and it emphasizes the low end.
581	The lead role of the guitar in heavy metal often collides with the traditional \"frontman\" or bandleader role of the vocalist, creating a musical tension as the two \"contend for dominance\" in a spirit of \"affectionate rivalry\".
582	Heavy metal \"demands the subordination of the voice\" to the overall sound of the band.
583	Reflecting metal's roots in the 1960s counterculture, an \"explicit display of emotion\" is required from the vocals as a sign of authenticity.
584	Critic Simon Frith claims that the metal singer's \"tone of voice\" is more important than the lyrics.
585	The prominent role of the bass is also key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and guitar is a central element.
586	The bass guitar provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music \"heavy\".
587	The bass plays a \"more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock\".
588	Metal basslines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low pedal point as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and licks along with the lead or rhythm guitars.
589	Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's Cliff Burton with his heavy emphasis on bass guitar solos and use of chords while playing bass in the early 1980s.
590	Lemmy of Motörhead often played overdriven power chords in his bass lines.
591	The essence of heavy metal drumming is creating a loud, constant beat for the band using the \"trifecta of speed, power, and precision\".
592	Heavy metal drumming \"requires an exceptional amount of endurance\", and drummers have to develop \"considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity ... to play the intricate patterns\" used in  heavy metal.
593	A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it with the other hand (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound.
594	The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music.
595	Black metal, death metal and some \"mainstream metal\" bands \"all depend upon double-kicks and blast beats\".
596	Enid Williams from Girlschool and Lemmy from Motörhead singing \"Please Don't Touch\" live in 2009.
597	The ties that bind the two bands started in the 1980s and were still strong in the 2010s.
598	In live performance, loudness—an \"onslaught of sound\", in sociologist Deena Weinstein's description—is considered vital.
599	In his book Metalheads, psychologist Jeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as \"the sensory equivalent of war\".
600	Following the lead set by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and The Who, early heavy metal acts such as Blue Cheer set new benchmarks for volume.
601	As Blue Cheer's Dick Peterson put it, \"All we knew was we wanted more power.\"
602	A 1977 review of a Motörhead concert noted how \"excessive volume in particular figured into the band's impact.\"
603	Weinstein makes the case that in the same way that melody is the main element of pop and rhythm is the main focus of house music, powerful sound, timbre, and volume are the key elements of metal.
604	She argues that the loudness is designed to \"sweep the listener into the sound\" and to provide a \"shot of youthful vitality\".
605	Heavy metal performers tended to be almost exclusively male until at least the mid-1980s apart from exceptions such as Girlschool.
606	However, by the 2010s women were making more of an impact, and PopMatters' Craig Hayes argues that metal \"clearly empowers women\".
607	In the sub-genres of symphonic and power metal, there has been a sizable number of bands that have had women as the lead singers; bands such as Nightwish, Delain, and Within Temptation have featured women as lead singers with men playing instruments.
608	Musical languageRhythm and tempoAn example of a rhythmic pattern used in heavy metal.
609	The upper stave is a palm-muted rhythm guitar part.
610	The lower stave is the drum part.
611	The rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses.
612	Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the \"rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency\".
613	In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note or three-note rhythmic figures—generally made up of 8th or 16th notes.
614	These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a staccato attack created by using a palm-muted technique on the rhythm guitar.
615	Brief, abrupt, and detached rhythmic cells are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture.
616	These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called riffs, which help to establish thematic hooks.
617	Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as whole note- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo power ballads.
618	The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be \"slow, even ponderous\".
619	By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos.
620	In the 2000s decade, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note =
621	60 beats per minute) to extremely fast blast beat tempos (quarter note =
622	350 beats per minute).
623	HarmonyOne of the signatures of the genre is the guitar power chord.
624	In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main interval, generally the perfect fifth, though an octave may be added as a doubling of the root.
625	When power chords are played on the lower strings at high volumes and with distortion, additional low frequency sounds are created, which add to the \"weight of the sound\" and create an effect of \"overwhelming power\".
626	Although the perfect fifth interval is the most common basis for the power chord, power chords are also based on different intervals such as the minor third, major third, perfect fourth, diminished fifth, or minor sixth.
627	Most power chords are also played with a consistent finger arrangement that can be slid easily up and down the fretboard.
628	Typical harmonic structuresHeavy metal is usually based on riffs created with three main harmonic traits: modal scale progressions, tritone and chromatic progressions, and the use of pedal points.
629	Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the Aeolian and Phrygian modes.
630	Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-♭VI-♭VII, I-♭VII-(♭VI), or I-♭VI-IV-♭VII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and ♭II (I-♭II-I, I-♭II-III, or I-♭II-VII for example).
631	Tense-sounding chromatic or tritone relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions.
632	In addition to using modal harmonic relationships, heavy metal also uses \"pentatonic and blues-derived features\".
633	The tritone, an interval spanning three whole tones—such as C to F#—was a forbidden dissonance in medieval ecclesiastical singing, which led monks to call it diabolus in musica—\"the devil in music\".
634	Heavy metal songs often make extensive use of pedal point as a harmonic basis.
635	A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign (i.e., dissonant) harmony is sounded in the other parts.
636	According to Robert Walser, heavy metal harmonic relationships are \"often quite complex\" and the harmonic analysis done by metal players and teachers is \"often very sophisticated\".
637	In the study of heavy metal chord structures, it has been concluded that \"heavy metal music has proved to be far more complicated\" than other music researchers had realized.
638	Relationship with classical musicRitchie Blackmore, founder of Deep Purple and Rainbow, known for the neoclassical approach in his guitar performances.
639	Robert Walser stated that, alongside blues and R&B, the \"assemblage of disparate musical styles known ... as 'classical music'\" has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre's earliest days.
640	Also that metal's \"most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music.
641	Their appropriation and adaptation of classical models sparked the development of a new kind of guitar virtuosity [and] changes in the harmonic and melodic language of heavy metal.
642	\"In an article written for Grove Music Online, Walser stated that the \"1980s brought on ... the widespread adaptation of chord progressions and virtuosic practices from 18th-century European models, especially Bach and Antonio Vivaldi, by influential guitarists such as Ritchie Blackmore, Marty Friedman, Jason Becker, Uli Jon Roth, Eddie Van Halen, Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen\".
643	Kurt Bachmann of Believer has stated that \"If done correctly, metal and classical fit quite well together.
644	Classical and metal are probably the two genres that have the most in common when it comes to feel, texture, creativity.\"
645	Although a number of metal musicians cite classical composers as inspiration, classical and metal are rooted in different cultural traditions and practices—classical in the art music tradition, metal in the popular music tradition.
646	As musicologists Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note, \"Analyses of popular music also sometimes reveal the influence of 'art traditions'.
647	An example is Walser's linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century Romanticism.
648	However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from \"art music'.
649	\"Lyrical themesAccording to scholars David Hatch and Stephen Millward, Black Sabbath, and the numerous heavy metal bands that they inspired, have concentrated lyrically \"on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music\".
650	They take as an example Sabbath's second album Paranoid (1970), which \"included songs dealing with personal trauma—'Paranoid' and 'Fairies Wear Boots' (which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking)—as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory 'War Pigs' and 'Hand of Doom'.\"
651	Deriving from the genre's roots in blues music, sex is another important topic—a thread running from Led Zeppelin's suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam metal and nu metal bands.
652	King Diamond, known for writing conceptual lyrics about horror stories.
653	The thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism.
654	According to Jon Pareles, \"Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal.
655	With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates ... a party without limits ...
656	[T]he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic.\"
657	Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny and the occult.
658	During the 1980s, the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs.
659	Andrew Cope states that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are \"clearly misguided\" as these critics have \"overlook[ed] the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise\".
660	Music critic Robert Christgau called metal \"an expressive mode [that] it sometimes seems will be with us for as long as ordinary white boys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat\".
661	Heavy metal artists have had to defend their lyrics in front of the U.S. Senate and in court.
662	In 1985, Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider was asked to defend his song \"Under the Blade\" at a U.S. Senate hearing.
663	At the hearing, the PMRC alleged that the song was about sadomasochism and rape; Snider stated that the song was about his bandmate's throat surgery.
664	In 1986, Ozzy Osbourne was sued over the lyrics of his song \"Suicide Solution\".
665	A lawsuit against Osbourne was filed by the parents of John McCollum, a depressed teenager who committed suicide allegedly after listening to Osbourne's song.
666	Osbourne was not found to be responsible for the teen's death.
667	In 1990, Judas Priest was sued in American court by the parents of two young men who had shot themselves five years earlier, allegedly after hearing the subliminal statement \"do it\" in the song Better by You, Better than Me, it was featured on the album Stained Class (1978), the song was also a Spooky Tooth cover.
668	While the case attracted a great deal of media attention, it was ultimately dismissed.
669	In 1991, UK police seized death metal records from the British record label Earache Records, in an \"unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the label for obscenity\".
670	In some predominantly Muslim countries, heavy metal has been officially denounced as a threat to traditional values.
671	In countries such as Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon, and Malaysia, there have been incidents of heavy metal musicians and fans being arrested and incarcerated.
672	In 1997, the Egyptian police jailed many young metal fans and they were accused of \"devil worship\" and blasphemy, after police found metal recordings during searches of their homes.
673	In 2013, Malaysia banned Lamb of God from performing in their country, on the grounds that the \"band's lyrics could be interpreted as being religiously insensitive\" and blasphemous.
674	Some people considered heavy metal music to being a leading factor for mental health disorders, and thought that heavy metal fans were more likely to suffer with a poor mental health, but study has proven that this is not true and the fans of this music have a lower or similar percentage of people suffering from poor mental health.
675	Image and fashionKiss performing in 2004, wearing makeup.
676	For many artists and bands, visual imagery plays a large role in heavy metal.
677	In addition to its sound and lyrics, a heavy metal band's image is expressed in album cover art, logos, stage sets, clothing, design of instruments, and music videos.
678	Down-the-back long hair is the \"most crucial distinguishing feature of metal fashion\".
679	Originally adopted from the hippie subculture, by the 1980s and 1990s heavy metal hair \"symbolised the hate, angst and disenchantment of a generation that seemingly never felt at home\", according to journalist Nader Rahman.
680	Long hair gave members of the metal community \"the power they needed to rebel against nothing in general\".
681	The classic uniform of heavy metal fans consists of light colored, ripped frayed or torn blue jeans, black T-shirts, boots, and black leather or denim jackets.
682	Deena Weinstein writes, \"T-shirts are generally emblazoned with the logos or other visual representations of favorite metal bands.\"
683	In the 1980s, a range of sources, from punk and goth music to horror films, influenced metal fashion.
684	Many metal performers of the 1970s and 1980s used radically shaped and brightly colored instruments to enhance their stage appearance.
685	Fashion and personal style was especially important for glam metal bands of the era.
686	Performers typically wore long, dyed, hairspray-teased hair (hence the nickname, \"hair metal\"); makeup such as lipstick and eyeliner; gaudy clothing, including leopard-skin-printed shirts or vests and tight denim, leather, or spandex pants; and accessories such as headbands and jewelry.
687	Pioneered by the heavy metal act X Japan in the late 1980s, bands in the Japanese movement known as visual kei—which includes many nonmetal groups—emphasize elaborate costumes, hair, and makeup.
688	Physical gestures Fans raise their fists and make the \"devil horns\" gesture at a Metsatöll concert.
689	Many metal musicians when performing live engage in headbanging, which involves rhythmically beating time with the head, often emphasized by long hair.
690	The il cornuto, or devil horns, hand gesture was popularized by vocalist Ronnie James Dio while with Black Sabbath and Dio.
691	Although Gene Simmons of Kiss claims to have been the first to make the gesture on the 1977 Love Gun album cover, there is speculation as to who started the phenomenon.
692	Attendees of metal concerts do not dance in the usual sense.
693	It has been argued that this is due to the music's largely male audience and \"extreme heterosexualist ideology\".
694	Two primary body movements used are headbanging and an arm thrust that is both a sign of appreciation and a rhythmic gesture.
695	The performance of air guitar is popular among metal fans both at concerts and listening to records at home.
696	According to Deena Weinstein, thrash metal concerts have two elements that are not part of the other metal genres: moshing and stage diving, which \"were imported from the punk/hardcore subculture\".
697	Weinstein states that moshing participants bump and jostle each other as they move in a circle in an area called the \"pit\" near the stage.
698	Stage divers climb onto the stage with the band and then jump \"back into the audience\".
699	Fan subcultureA heavy metal fan wearing a denim jacket with band patches and artwork of the heavy metal bands Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Iron Maiden, Slipknot, Dio and Led Zeppelin.
700	It has been argued that heavy metal has outlasted many other rock genres largely due to the emergence of an intense, exclusionary, strongly masculine subculture.
701	While the metal fan base is largely young, white, male, and blue-collar, the group is \"tolerant of those outside its core demographic base who follow its codes of dress, appearance, and behavior\".
702	Identification with the subculture is strengthened not only by the group experience of concert-going and shared elements of fashion, but also by contributing to metal magazines and, more recently, websites.
703	Attending live concerts in particular has been called the \"holiest of heavy metal communions.
704	\"The metal scene has been characterized as a \"subculture of alienation\", with its own code of authenticity.
705	This code puts several demands on performers: they must appear both completely devoted to their music and loyal to the subculture that supports it; they must appear uninterested in mainstream appeal and radio hits; and they must never \"sell out\".
706	Deena Weinstein states that for the fans themselves, the code promotes \"opposition to established authority, and separateness from the rest of society\".
707	Musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie observes, \"Most of the kids who come to my shows seem like really imaginative kids with a lot of creative energy they don't know what to do with\" and that metal is \"outsider music for outsiders.
708	Nobody wants to be the weird kid; you just somehow end up being the weird kid.
709	It's kind of like that, but with metal you have all the weird kids in one place\".
710	Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers (and some other fans) as \"poseurs\" \"who pretended to be part of the subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity\".
711	EtymologyThe origin of the term \"heavy metal\" in a musical context is uncertain.
712	The phrase has been used for centuries in chemistry and metallurgy, where the periodic table organizes elements of both light and heavy metals (e.g., uranium).
713	An early use of the term in modern popular culture was by countercultural writer William S. Burroughs.
714	His 1962 novel The Soft Machine includes a character known as \"Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid\".
715	Burroughs' next novel, Nova Express (1964), develops the theme, using heavy metal as a metaphor for addictive drugs: \"With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms—Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes—And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music\".
716	Inspired by Burroughs' novels, the term was used in the title of the 1967 album Featuring the Human Host and the Heavy Metal Kids by Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, which has been claimed to be its first use in the context of music.
717	The phrase was later lifted by Sandy Pearlman, who used the term to describe The Byrds for their supposed \"aluminium style of context and effect\", particularly on their album The Notorious Byrd Brothers (1968).
718	Metal historian Ian Christe describes what the components of the term mean in \"hippiespeak\": \"heavy\" is roughly synonymous with \"potent\" or \"profound,\" and \"metal\" designates a certain type of mood, grinding and weighted as with metal.
719	The word \"heavy\" in this sense was a basic element of beatnik and later countercultural hippie slang, and references to \"heavy music\"—typically slower, more amplified variations of standard pop fare—were already common by the mid-1960s, such as in reference to Vanilla Fudge.
720	Iron Butterfly's debut album, released in early 1968, was titled Heavy.
721	The first use of \"heavy metal\" in a song lyric is in reference to a motorcycle in the Steppenwolf song \"Born to Be Wild\", also released that year: \"I like smoke and lightning/Heavy metal thunder/Racin' with the wind/
722	And the feelin' that I'm under.
723	\"The first documented use of the phrase to describe a type of rock music identified to date appears in a review by Barry Gifford.
724	In the May 11, 1968, issue of Rolling Stone, he wrote about the album A Long Time Comin' by U.S. band Electric Flag: \"Nobody who's been listening to Mike Bloomfield—either talking or playing—in the last few years could have expected this.
725	This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock.\"
726	In January 1970 Lucian K. Truscott IV reviewing Led Zeppelin II for the Village Voice described the sound as \"heavy\" and made comparisons with Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge.
727	Other early documented uses of the phrase are from reviews by critic Mike Saunders.
728	In the November 12, 1970 issue of Rolling Stone, he commented on an album put out the previous year by the British band Humble Pie: \"Safe as Yesterday Is, their first American release, proved that Humble Pie could be boring in lots of different ways.
729	Here they were a noisy, unmelodic, heavy metal-leaden shit-rock band with the loud and noisy parts beyond doubt.
730	There were a couple of nice songs ... and one monumental pile of refuse\".
731	He described the band's latest, self-titled release as \"more of the same 27th-rate heavy metal crap\".
732	In a review of Sir Lord Baltimore's Kingdom Come in the May 1971 Creem, Saunders wrote, \"Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best heavy metal tricks in the book\".
733	Creem critic Lester Bangs is credited with popularizing the term via his early 1970s essays on bands such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.
734	Through the decade, heavy metal was used by certain critics as a virtually automatic putdown.
735	In 1979, lead New York Times popular music critic John Rockwell described what he called \"heavy-metal rock\" as \"brutally aggressive music played mostly for minds clouded by drugs\", and, in a different article, as \"a crude exaggeration of rock basics that appeals to white teenagers\".
736	Coined by Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward, \"downer rock\" was one of the earliest terms used to describe this style of music and was applied to acts such as Sabbath and Bloodrock.
737	Classic Rock magazine described the downer rock culture revolving around the use of Quaaludes and the drinking of wine.
738	Later the term would be replaced by \"heavy metal\".
739	Earlier on, as \"heavy metal\" emerged partially from the heavy psychedelic rock scene, also known as acid rock, \"acid rock\" was often used interchangeably with \"heavy metal\" and \"hard rock\".
740	Musicologist Steve Waksman stated that \"the distinction between acid rock, hard rock, and heavy metal can at some point never be more than tenuous\", while percussionist John Beck defined \"acid rock\" as synonymous with hard rock and heavy metal.
741	Apart from \"acid rock\", the terms \"heavy metal\" and \"hard rock\" have often been used interchangeably, particularly in discussing bands of the 1970s, a period when the terms were largely synonymous.
742	For example, the 1983 Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll includes this passage: \"known for its aggressive blues-based hard-rock style, Aerosmith was the top American heavy-metal band of the mid-Seventies\".
743	HistoryAntecedents: 1950s to late 1960sHeavy metal's quintessential guitar style, built around distortion-heavy riffs and power chords, traces its roots to early 1950s Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson, and particularly Pat Hare, who captured a \"grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound\" on records such as James Cotton's \"Cotton Crop Blues \" (1954);  the late 1950s instrumentals of Link Wray, particularly \"Rumble\" (1958); the early 1960s surf rock of Dick Dale, including \"Let's Go Trippin'\" (1961) and \"Misirlou\" (1962); and The Kingsmen's version of \"Louie Louie\" (1963) which made it a garage rock standard.
744	Cream performing on the Dutch television program Fanclub in 1968.
745	However, the genre's direct lineage begins in the mid-1960s.
746	American blues music was a major influence on the early British rockers of the era.
747	Bands like The Rolling Stones and The Yardbirds developed blues rock by recording covers of classic blues songs, often speeding up the tempos.
748	As they experimented with the music, the UK blues-based bands—and the U.S. acts they influenced in turn—developed what would become the hallmarks of heavy metal, in particular, the loud, distorted guitar sound.
749	The Kinks played a major role in popularising this sound with their 1964 hit \"You Really Got Me\".
750	In addition to The Kinks' Dave Davies, other guitarists such as The Who's Pete Townshend and The Yardbirds' Jeff Beck were experimenting with feedback.
751	Where the blues rock drumming style started out largely as simple shuffle beats on small kits, drummers began using a more muscular, complex, and amplified approach to match and be heard against the increasingly loud guitar.
752	Vocalists similarly modified their technique and increased their reliance on amplification, often becoming more stylized and dramatic.
753	In terms of sheer volume, especially in live performance, The Who's \"bigger-louder-wall-of-Marshalls\" approach was seminal.
754	The combination of blues rock with psychedelic rock and acid rock formed much of the original basis for heavy metal.
755	The variant or subgenre of psychedelic rock often known as \"acid rock\" was particularly influential on heavy metal; acid rock is often defined as a heavier, louder, or harder variant of psychedelic rock, or the more extreme side of the psychedelic rock genre, frequently containing a loud, improvised, and heavily distorted guitar-centered sound.
756	Acid rock has been described as psychedelic rock at its \"rawest and most intense,\" emphasizing the heavier qualities associated with both the positive and negative extremes of the psychedelic experience rather than only the idyllic side of psychedelia.
757	American acid rock garage bands such as the 13th Floor Elevators epitomized the frenetic, heavier, darker and more psychotic sound of acid rock, a sound characterized by droning guitar riffs, amplified feedback, and guitar distortion, while the 13th Floor Elevators' sound in particular featured yelping vocals and \"occasionally demented\" lyrics.
758	Frank Hoffman notes that: \"Psychedelia was sometimes referred to as 'acid rock'.
759	The latter label was applied to a pounding, hard rock variant that evolved out of the mid-1960s garage-punk movement. ...
760	When rock began turning back to softer, roots-oriented sounds in late 1968, acid-rock bands mutated into heavy metal acts.
761	\"One of the most influential bands in forging the merger of psychedelic rock and acid rock with the blues rock genre was the British power trio Cream, who derived a massive, heavy sound from unison riffing between guitarist Eric Clapton and bassist Jack Bruce, as well as Ginger Baker's double bass drumming.
762	Their first two LPs, Fresh Cream (1966) and Disraeli Gears (1967), are regarded as essential prototypes for the future style of heavy metal.
763	The Jimi Hendrix Experience's debut album, Are You Experienced (1967), was also highly influential.
764	Hendrix's virtuosic technique would be emulated by many metal guitarists and the album's most successful single, \"Purple Haze\", is identified by some as the first heavy metal hit.
765	Vanilla Fudge, whose first album also came out in 1967, has been called \"one of the few American links between psychedelia and what soon became heavy metal\", and the band has been cited as an early American heavy metal group.
766	On their self-titled debut album, Vanilla Fudge created \"loud, heavy, slowed-down arrangements\" of contemporary hit songs, blowing these songs up to \"epic proportions\" and \"bathing them in a trippy, distorted haze.
767	\"During the late 1960s, many psychedelic singers, such as Arthur Brown, began to create outlandish, theatrical and often macabre performances; which in itself became incredibly influential to many metal acts.
768	The American psychedelic rock band Coven, who opened for early heavy metal influencers such as Vanilla Fudge and the Yardbirds, portrayed themselves as practitioners of witchcraft or black magic, using dark—Satanic or occult—imagery in their lyrics, album art, and live performances.
769	Live shows consisted of elaborate, theatrical \"Satanic rites.\"
770	Coven's 1969 debut album, Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls, featured imagery of skulls, black masses, inverted crosses, and Satan worship, and both the album artwork and the band's live performances marked the first appearances in rock music of the sign of the horns, which would later become an important gesture in heavy metal culture.
771	At the same time in England, the band Black Widow were also among the first psychedelic rock bands to use occult and Satanic imagery and lyrics, though both Black Widow and Coven's lyrical and thematic influences on heavy metal were quickly overshadowed by the darker and heavier sounds of Black Sabbath.
772	Origins: late 1960s and early 1970sJohn Kay of Steppenwolf.
773	Critics disagree over who can be thought of as the first heavy metal band.
774	Most credit either Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath, with American commentators tending to favour Led Zeppelin and British commentators tending to favour Black Sabbath, though many give equal credit to both.
775	A few commentators—mainly American—argue for other groups including Iron Butterfly, Steppenwolf or Blue Cheer.
776	Deep Purple, the third band in what is sometimes considered the \"unholy trinity\" of heavy metal (Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple), despite being slightly older than Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, fluctuated between many rock styles until late 1969 when they took a heavy metal direction.
777	In 1968, the sound that would become known as heavy metal began to coalesce.
778	That January, the San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a cover of Eddie Cochran's classic \"Summertime Blues\", from their debut album Vincebus Eruptum, that many consider the first true heavy metal recording.
779	The same month, Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album, including \"Born to Be Wild\", which refers to \"heavy metal thunder\" in describing a motorcycle.
780	In July, the Jeff Beck Group, whose leader had preceded Page as The Yardbirds' guitarist, released its debut record: Truth featured some of the \"most molten, barbed, downright funny noises of all time,\" breaking ground for generations of metal ax-slingers.
781	In September, Page's new band, Led Zeppelin, made its live debut in Denmark (billed as The New Yardbirds).
782	The Beatles' White Album, released the following month, included \"Helter Skelter\", then one of the heaviest-sounding songs ever released by a major band.
783	The Pretty Things' rock opera S.F. Sorrow, released in December, featured \"proto heavy metal\" songs such as \"Old Man Going\" and \"I See You\".
784	Iron Butterfly's 1968 song  \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" is sometimes described as an example of the transition between acid rock and heavy metal or the turning point in which acid rock became \"heavy metal\", and both Iron Butterfly's 1968 album In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida and Blue Cheer's 1968 album Vincebus Eruptum have been described as laying the foundation of heavy metal and greatly influential in the transformation of acid rock into heavy metal.
785	In this counterculture period MC5, who began as part of the Detroit garage rock scene, developed a raw distorted style that has been seen as a major influence on the future sound of both heavy metal and later punk music.
786	The Stooges also began to establish and influence a heavy metal and later punk sound, with songs such as \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\", featuring pounding and distorted heavy guitar power chord riffs.
787	Pink Floyd released two of their heaviest and loudest songs to date; \"Ibiza Bar\" and \"The Nile Song\", which was regarded as \"one of the heaviest songs the band recorded\".
788	King Crimson's debut album started with \"21st Century Schizoid Man,\" which was considered heavy metal by several critics.
789	In January 1969, Led Zeppelin's self-titled debut album was released and reached number 10 on the Billboard album chart.
790	In July, Zeppelin and a power trio with a Cream-inspired, but cruder sound, Grand Funk Railroad, played the Atlanta Pop Festival.
791	That same month, another Cream-rooted trio led by Leslie West released Mountain, an album filled with heavy blues rock guitar and roaring vocals.
792	In August, the group—now itself dubbed Mountain—played an hour-long set at the Woodstock Festival, exposing the crowd of 300,000 people to the emerging sound of heavy metal.
793	Mountain's proto-metal or early heavy metal hit song \"Mississippi Queen\" from the album Climbing! is especially credited with paving the way for heavy metal and was one of the first heavy guitar songs to receive regular play on radio.
794	In September 1969, the Beatles released the album Abbey Road containing the track \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" which has been credited as an early example of or influence on heavy metal or doom metal.
795	In October 1969, British band High Tide debuted with the heavy, proto-metal album Sea Shanties.
796	Led Zeppelin defined central aspects of the emerging genre, with Page's highly distorted guitar style and singer Robert Plant's dramatic, wailing vocals.
797	Other bands, with a more consistently heavy, \"purely\" metal sound, would prove equally important in codifying the genre.
798	The 1970 releases by Black Sabbath (Black Sabbath and Paranoid) and Deep Purple (In Rock) were crucial in this regard.
799	Birmingham's Black Sabbath had developed a particularly heavy sound in part due to an industrial accident guitarist Tony Iommi suffered before cofounding the band.
800	Unable to play normally, Iommi had to tune his guitar down for easier fretting and rely on power chords with their relatively simple fingering.
801	The bleak, industrial, working class environment of Birmingham, a manufacturing city full of noisy factories and metalworking, has itself been credited with influencing Black Sabbath's heavy, chugging, metallic sound and the sound of heavy metal in general.
802	Deep Purple had fluctuated between styles in its early years, but by 1969 vocalist Ian Gillan and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had led the band toward the developing heavy metal style.
803	In 1970, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple scored major UK chart hits with \"Paranoid\" and \"Black Night\", respectively.
804	That same year, two other British bands released debut albums in a heavy metal mode: Uriah Heep with ...Very 'Eavy ...Very 'Umble and UFO with UFO 1.
805	Bloodrock released their self-titled debut album, containing a collection of heavy guitar riffs, gruff style vocals and sadistic and macabre lyrics.
806	The influential Budgie brought the new metal sound into a power trio context, creating some of the heaviest music of the time.
807	The occult lyrics and imagery employed by Black Sabbath and Uriah Heep would prove particularly influential; Led Zeppelin also began foregrounding such elements with its fourth album, released in 1971.
808	In 1973, Deep Purple released the song \"Smoke on the Water\", with the iconic riff that's usually considered as the most recognizable one in \"heavy rock\" history, as a single of the classic live album Made in Japan.
809	Brian Robertson, Phil Lynott, Scott Gorham of Thin Lizzy performing during the Bad Reputation Tour, November 24, 1977.
810	On the other side of the Atlantic, the trend-setting group was Grand Funk Railroad, described as \"the most commercially successful American heavy-metal band from 1970 until they disbanded in 1976, [they] established the Seventies success formula: continuous touring\".
811	Other influential bands identified with metal emerged in the U.S., such as Sir Lord Baltimore (Kingdom Come, 1970), Blue Öyster Cult (Blue Öyster Cult, 1972), Aerosmith (Aerosmith, 1973) and Kiss (Kiss, 1974).
812	Sir Lord Baltimore's 1970 debut album and both Humble Pie's debut and self-titled third album were all among the first albums to be described in print as \"heavy metal\", with As Safe As Yesterday Is being referred to by the term \"heavy metal\" in a 1970 review in Rolling Stone magazine.
813	Various smaller bands from the U.S., U.K, and Continental Europe, including Bang, Josefus, Leaf Hound, Primeval, Hard Stuff,  Truth and Janey, Dust, JPT Scare Band, Frijid Pink, Cactus, May Blitz, Captain Beyond, Toad, Granicus, Iron Claw, and Yesterday's Children, though lesser known outside of their respective scenes, proved to be greatly influential on the emerging metal movement.
814	In Germany, Scorpions debuted with Lonesome Crow in 1972.
815	Blackmore, who had emerged as a virtuoso soloist with Deep Purple's highly influential album Machine Head (1972), left the band in 1975 to form Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio, singer and bassist for blues rock band Elf and future vocalist for Black Sabbath and heavy metal band Dio.
816	Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio would expand on the mystical and fantasy-based lyrics and themes sometimes found in heavy metal, pioneering both power metal and neoclassical metal.
817	These bands also built audiences via constant touring and increasingly elaborate stage shows.
818	As described above, there are arguments about whether these and other early bands truly qualify as \"heavy metal\" or simply as \"hard rock\".
819	Those closer to the music's blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label.
820	AC/DC, which debuted with High Voltage in 1975, is a prime example.
821	The 1983 Rolling Stone encyclopedia entry begins, \"Australian heavy-metal band AC/DC\".
822	Rock historian Clinton Walker writes, \"Calling AC/DC a heavy metal band in the seventies was as inaccurate as it is today. ...
823	[They] were a rock 'n' roll band that just happened to be heavy enough for metal\".
824	The issue is not only one of shifting definitions, but also a persistent distinction between musical style and audience identification: Ian Christe describes how the band \"became the stepping-stone that led huge numbers of hard rock fans into heavy metal perdition\".
825	In certain cases, there is little debate.
826	After Black Sabbath, the next major example is Britain's Judas Priest, which debuted with Rocka Rolla in 1974.
827	In Christe's description,Black Sabbath's audience was ... left to scavenge for sounds with similar impact.
828	By the mid-1970s, heavy metal aesthetic could be spotted, like a mythical beast, in the moody bass and complex dual guitars of Thin Lizzy, in the stagecraft of Alice Cooper, in the sizzling guitar and showy vocals of Queen, and in the thundering medieval questions of Rainbow. ...
829	Judas Priest arrived to unify and amplify these diverse highlights from hard rock's sonic palette.
830	For the first time, heavy metal became a true genre unto itself.
831	Though Judas Priest did not have a top 40 album in the United States until 1980, for many it was the definitive post-Sabbath heavy metal band; its twin-guitar attack, featuring rapid tempos and a non-bluesy, more cleanly metallic sound, was a major influence on later acts.
832	While heavy metal was growing in popularity, most critics were not enamored of the music.
833	Objections were raised to metal's adoption of visual spectacle and other trappings of commercial artifice, but the main offense was its perceived musical and lyrical vacuity: reviewing a Black Sabbath album in the early 1970s, leading critic Robert Christgau described it as \"dull and decadent ...
834	dim-witted, amoral exploitation.
835	\"Mainstream: late 1970s and 1980sIron Maiden, one of the central bands in the new wave of British heavy metal.
836	Punk rock emerged in the mid-1970s as a reaction against contemporary social conditions as well as what was perceived as the overindulgent, overproduced rock music of the time, including heavy metal.
837	Sales of heavy metal records declined sharply in the late 1970s in the face of punk, disco, and more mainstream rock.
838	With the major labels fixated on punk, many newer British heavy metal bands were inspired by the movement's aggressive, high-energy sound and \"lo-fi\", do it yourself ethos.
839	Underground metal bands began putting out cheaply recorded releases independently to small, devoted audiences.
840	Motörhead, founded in 1975, was the first important band to straddle the punk/metal divide.
841	With the explosion of punk in 1977, others followed.
842	British music papers such as the NME and Sounds took notice, with Sounds writer Geoff Barton christening the movement the \"New Wave of British Heavy Metal\".
843	NWOBHM bands including Iron Maiden, Saxon, and Def Leppard re-energized the heavy metal genre.
844	Following the lead set by Judas Priest and Motörhead, they toughened up the sound, reduced its blues elements, and emphasized increasingly fast tempos.
845	By 1980, the NWOBHM had broken into the mainstream, as albums by Iron Maiden and Saxon, as well as Motörhead, reached the British top 10.
846	Though less commercially successful, other NWOBHM bands such as Venom and Diamond Head would have a significant influence on metal's development.
847	In 1981, Motörhead became the first of this new breed of metal bands to top the UK charts with the live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith.
848	The first generation of metal bands was ceding the limelight.
849	Deep Purple had broken up soon after Blackmore's departure in 1975, and Led Zeppelin broke up following drummer John Bonham's death in 1980.
850	Black Sabbath plagued with infighting and substance abuse, while facing fierce competition with their opening band, the Los Angeles band Van Halen.
851	Eddie Van Halen established himself as one of the leading metal guitarists of the era.
852	His solo on \"Eruption\", from the band's self-titled 1978 album, is considered a milestone.
853	 Eddie Van Halen's sound even crossed over into pop music when his guitar solo was featured on the track \"Beat It\" by Michael Jackson (a U.S. number 1 in February 1983).
854	Inspired by Van Halen's success, a metal scene began to develop in Southern California during the late 1970s.
855	Based on the clubs of L.A.'s Sunset Strip, bands such as Quiet Riot, Ratt, Mötley Crüe, and W.A.S.P. were influenced by traditional heavy metal of the earlier 1970s.
856	These acts incorporated the theatrics (and sometimes makeup) of glam metal or \"hair metal\" such as Alice Cooper and Kiss.
857	Glam metal bands were often visually distinguished by long, overworked hair styles accompanied by wardrobes which were sometimes considered cross-gender.
858	The lyrics of these glam metal bands characteristically emphasized hedonism and wild behavior, including lyrics which involved sexual expletives and the use of narcotics.
859	In the wake of the new wave of British heavy metal and Judas Priest's breakthrough British Steel (1980), heavy metal became increasingly popular in the early 1980s.
860	Many metal artists benefited from the exposure they received on MTV, which began airing in 1981—sales often soared if a band's videos screened on the channel.
861	Def Leppard's videos for Pyromania (1983) made them superstars in America and Quiet Riot became the first domestic heavy metal band to top the Billboard chart with Metal Health (1983).
862	One of the seminal events in metal's growing popularity was the 1983 US Festival in California, where the \"heavy metal day\" featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Scorpions, Mötley Crüe, Judas Priest, and others drew the largest audiences of the three-day event.
863	Between 1983 and 1984, heavy metal went from an 8 percent to a 20 percent share of all recordings sold in the U.S.
864	Several major professional magazines devoted to the genre were launched, including Kerrang!
865	(in 1981) and Metal Hammer (in 1984), as well as a host of fan journals.
866	In 1985, Billboard declared, \"Metal has broadened its audience base.
867	Metal music is no longer the exclusive domain of male teenagers.
868	The metal audience has become older (college-aged), younger (pre-teen), and more female\".
869	By the mid-1980s, glam metal was a dominant presence on the U.S. charts, music television, and the arena concert circuit.
870	New bands such as L.A.'s Warrant and acts from the East Coast like Poison and Cinderella became major draws, while Mötley Crüe and Ratt remained very popular.
871	Bridging the stylistic gap between hard rock and glam metal, New Jersey's Bon Jovi became enormously successful with its third album, Slippery When Wet (1986).
872	The similarly styled Swedish band Europe became international stars with The Final Countdown (1986).
873	Its title track hit number 1 in 25 countries.
874	In 1987, MTV launched a show, Headbanger's Ball, devoted exclusively to heavy metal videos.
875	However, the metal audience had begun to factionalize, with those in many underground metal scenes favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular style as \"light metal\" or \"hair metal\".
876	One band that reached diverse audiences was Guns N' Roses.
877	In contrast to their glam metal contemporaries in L.A., they were seen as much more raw and dangerous.
878	With the release of their chart-topping Appetite for Destruction (1987), they \"recharged and almost single-handedly sustained the Sunset Strip sleaze system for several years\".
879	The following year, Jane's Addiction emerged from the same L.A. hard-rock club scene with its major label debut, Nothing's Shocking.
880	Reviewing the album, Rolling Stone declared, \"as much as any band in existence, Jane's Addiction is the true heir to Led Zeppelin\".
881	The group was one of the first to be identified with the \"alternative metal\" trend that would come to the fore in the next decade.
882	Meanwhile, new bands such as New York's Winger and New Jersey's Skid Row sustained the popularity of the glam metal style.
883	Other heavy metal genres: 1980s, 1990s, and 2000sDrummer Eric Moore from crossover thrash band Suicidal Tendencies.
884	Many subgenres of heavy metal developed outside of the commercial mainstream during the 1980s such as crossover thrash.
885	Several attempts have been made to map the complex world of underground metal, most notably by the editors of AllMusic, as well as critic Garry Sharpe-Young.
886	Sharpe-Young's multivolume metal encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories: thrash metal, death metal, black metal, power metal, and the related subgenres of doom and gothic metal.
887	In 1990, a review in Rolling Stone suggested retiring the term \"heavy metal\" as the genre was \"ridiculously vague\".
888	The article stated that the term only fueled \"misperceptions of rock & roll bigots who still assume that five bands as different as Ratt, Extreme, Anthrax, Danzig and Mother Love Bone\" sound the same.
889	Thrash metalThrash metal band Slayer performing in 2007 in front of a wall of speaker stacks.
890	Thrash metal emerged in the early 1980s under the influence of hardcore punk and the new wave of British heavy metal, particularly songs in the revved-up style known as speed metal.
891	The movement began in the United States, with Bay Area thrash metal being the leading scene.
892	The sound developed by thrash groups was faster and more aggressive than that of the original metal bands and their glam metal successors.
893	Low-register guitar riffs are typically overlaid with shredding leads.
894	Lyrics often express nihilistic views or deal with social issues using visceral, gory language.
895	Thrash has been described as a form of \"urban blight music\" and \"a palefaced cousin of rap\".
896	The subgenre was popularized by the \"Big Four of Thrash\": Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer.
897	Three German bands, Kreator, Sodom, and Destruction, played a central role in bringing the style to Europe.
898	Others, including San Francisco Bay Area's Testament and Exodus, New Jersey's Overkill, and Brazil's Sepultura and Sarcófago, also had a significant impact.
899	Although thrash began as an underground movement, and remained largely that for almost a decade, the leading bands of the scene began to reach a wider audience.
900	Metallica brought the sound into the top 40 of the Billboard album chart in 1986 with Master of Puppets, the genre's first platinum record.
901	Two years later, the band's ...And Justice for All hit number 6, while Megadeth and Anthrax also had top 40 records on the American charts.
902	Though less commercially successful than the rest of the Big Four, Slayer released one of the genre's definitive records: Reign in Blood (1986) was credited for incorporating heavier guitar timbres, and for including explicit depictions of death, suffering, violence and occult into thrash metal's lyricism.
903	Slayer attracted a following among far-right skinheads, and accusations of promoting violence and Nazi themes have dogged the band.
904	Even though Slayer did not receive substantial media exposure, their music played a key role in the development of extreme metal.
905	In the early 1990s, thrash achieved breakout success, challenging and redefining the metal mainstream.
906	Metallica's self-titled 1991 album topped the Billboard chart, as the band established international following.
907	Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction (1992) debuted at number two, Anthrax and Slayer cracked the top 10, and albums by regional bands such as Testament and Sepultura entered the top 100.
908	Death metalDeath's Chuck Schuldiner, \"widely recognized as the father of death metal\".
909	Thrash soon began to evolve and split into more extreme metal genres.
910	\"Slayer's music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal,\" according to MTV News.
911	The NWOBHM band Venom was also an important progenitor.
912	The death metal movement in both North America and Europe adopted and emphasized the elements of blasphemy and diabolism employed by such acts.
913	Florida's Death, San Francisco Bay Area's Possessed, and Ohio's Necrophagia are recognized as seminal bands in the style.
914	Both groups have been credited with inspiring the subgenre's name, the latter via its 1984 demo Death Metal and the song \"Death Metal\", from its 1985 debut album Seven Churches (1985).
915	In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Swedish death metal became notable and melodic forms of death metal were created.
916	Death metal utilizes the speed and aggression of both thrash and hardcore, fused with lyrics preoccupied with Z-grade slasher movie violence and Satanism.
917	Death metal vocals are typically bleak, involving guttural \"death growls\", high-pitched screaming, the \"death rasp\", and other uncommon techniques.
918	Complementing the deep, aggressive vocal style are downtuned, heavily distorted guitars and extremely fast percussion, often with rapid double bass drumming and \"wall of sound\"–style blast beats.
919	Frequent tempo and time signature changes and syncopation are also typical.
920	Death metal, like thrash metal, generally rejects the theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets.
921	One major exception to this rule was Deicide's Glen Benton, who branded an inverted cross on his forehead and wore armor on stage.
922	Morbid Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery.
923	These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s.
924	In the UK, the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged from the anarcho-punk movement.
925	Black metalThe first wave of black metal emerged in Europe in the early and mid-1980s, led by the United Kingdom's Venom, Denmark's Mercyful Fate, Switzerland's Hellhammer and Celtic Frost, and Sweden's Bathory.
926	By the late 1980s, Norwegian bands such as Mayhem and Burzum were heading a second wave.
927	Black metal varies considerably in style and production quality, although most bands emphasize shrieked and growled vocals, highly distorted guitars frequently played with rapid tremolo picking, a dark atmosphere and intentionally lo-fi production, with ambient noise and background hiss.
928	Satanic themes are common in black metal, though many bands take inspiration from ancient paganism, promoting a return to supposed pre-Christian values.
929	Numerous black metal bands also \"experiment with sounds from all possible forms of metal, folk, classical music, electronica and avant-garde\".
930	Darkthrone drummer Fenriz explains, \"It had something to do with production, lyrics, the way they dressed and a commitment to making ugly, raw, grim stuff.
931	There wasn't a generic sound.
932	\"Although bands such as Sarcófago had been donning corpsepaint, by 1990, Mayhem was regularly wearing corpsepaint; many other black metal acts also adopted the look.
933	Bathory inspired the Viking metal and folk metal movements and Immortal brought blast beats to the fore.
934	Some bands in the Scandinavian black metal scene became associated with considerable violence in the early 1990s, with Mayhem and Burzum linked to church burnings.
935	Growing commercial hype around death metal generated a backlash; beginning in Norway, much of the Scandinavian metal underground shifted to support a black metal scene that resisted being co-opted by the commercial metal industry.
936	By 1992, black metal scenes had begun to emerge in areas outside Scandinavia, including Germany, France, and Poland.
937	The 1993 murder of Mayhem's Euronymous by Burzum's Varg Vikernes provoked intensive media coverage.
938	Around 1996, when many in the scene felt the genre was stagnating, several key bands, including Burzum and Finland's Beherit, moved toward an ambient style, while symphonic black metal was explored by Sweden's Tiamat and Switzerland's Samael.
939	In the late 1990s and early 2000s decade, Norway's Dimmu Borgir brought black metal closer to the mainstream, as did Cradle of Filth.
940	Power metalSwedish power metal band HammerFall after a concert in Milan, Italy, in 2005.
941	Italian band Rhapsody of Fire performing in Buenos Aires in 2010.
942	During the late 1980s, the power metal scene came together largely in reaction to the harshness of death and black metal.
943	Though a relatively underground style in North America, it enjoys wide popularity in Europe, Japan, and South America.
944	Power metal focuses on upbeat, epic melodies and themes that \"appeal to the listener's sense of valor and loveliness\".
945	The prototype for the sound was established in the mid-to-late 1980s by Germany's Helloween, which combined the power riffs, melodic approach, and high-pitched, \"clean\" singing style of bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden with thrash's speed and energy, \"crystalliz[ing] the sonic ingredients of what is now known as power metal\".
946	Traditional power metal bands like Sweden's HammerFall, England's DragonForce, and America's Iced Earth have a sound clearly indebted to the classic NWOBHM style.
947	Many power metal bands such as America's Kamelot, Finnish groups Nightwish, Stratovarius and Sonata Arctica, Italy's Rhapsody of Fire, and Russia's Catharsis feature a keyboard-based \"symphonic\" sound, sometimes employing orchestras and opera singers.
948	Power metal has built a strong fanbase in Japan and South America, where bands like Brazil's Angra and Argentina's Rata Blanca are popular.
949	Closely related to power metal is progressive metal, which adopts the complex compositional approach of bands like Rush and King Crimson.
950	This style emerged in the United States in the early and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Dream Theater.
951	The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo is among the most recognized of latter-day shredders.
952	Doom metalEmerging in the mid-1980s with such bands as California's Saint Vitus, Maryland's The Obsessed, Chicago's Trouble, and Sweden's Candlemass, the doom metal movement rejected other metal styles' emphasis on speed, slowing its music to a crawl.
953	Doom metal traces its roots to the lyrical themes and musical approach of early Black Sabbath.
954	The Melvins have also been a significant influence on doom metal and a number of its subgenres.
955	Doom emphasizes melody, melancholy tempos, and a sepulchral mood relative to many other varieties of metal.
956	The 1991 release of Forest of Equilibrium, the debut album by UK band Cathedral, helped spark a new wave of doom metal.
957	During the same period, the doom-death fusion style of British bands Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, and Anathema gave rise to European gothic metal, with its signature dual-vocalist arrangements, exemplified by Norway's Theatre of Tragedy and Tristania.
958	New York's Type O Negative introduced an American take on the style.
959	In the United States, sludge metal, mixing doom and hardcore, emerged in the late 1980s—Eyehategod and Crowbar were leaders in a major Louisiana sludge scene.
960	Early in the next decade, California's Kyuss and Sleep, inspired by the earlier doom metal bands, spearheaded the rise of stoner metal, while Seattle's Earth helped develop the drone metal subgenre.
961	The late 1990s saw new bands form such as the Los Angeles–based Goatsnake, with a classic stoner/doom sound, and Sunn O))), which crosses lines between doom, drone, and dark ambient metal—the New York Times has compared their sound to an \"Indian raga in the middle of an earthquake\".
962	1990s and early 2000s subgenres and fusionsItalian band Lacuna Coil, one of the most successful gothic metal groups.
963	The era of heavy metal's mainstream dominance in North America came to an end in the early 1990s with the emergence of Nirvana and other grunge bands, signaling the popular breakthrough of alternative rock.
964	Grunge acts were influenced by the heavy metal sound, but rejected the excesses of the more popular metal bands, such as their \"flashy and virtuosic solos\" and \"appearance-driven\" MTV orientation.
965	Glam metal fell out of favor due not only to the success of grunge, but also because of the growing popularity of the more aggressive sound typified by Metallica and the post-thrash groove metal of Pantera and White Zombie.
966	In 1991, the band Metallica released their album Metallica, also known as The Black Album, which moved the band's sound out of the thrash metal genre and into standard heavy metal.
967	The album was certified 16× Platinum by the RIAA.
968	A few new, unambiguously metal bands had commercial success during the first half of the decade—Pantera's Far Beyond Driven topped the Billboard chart in 1994—but, \"In the dull eyes of the mainstream, metal was dead\".
969	Some bands tried to adapt to the new musical landscape.
970	Metallica revamped its image: the band members cut their hair and, in 1996, headlined the alternative musical festival Lollapalooza founded by Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell.
971	While this prompted a backlash among some long-time fans, Metallica remained one of the most successful bands in the world into the new century.
972	Layne Staley of Alice in Chains, one of the most popular acts identified with alternative metal performing in 1992.
973	Like Jane's Addiction, many of the most popular early 1990s groups with roots in heavy metal fall under the umbrella term \"alternative metal\".
974	Bands in Seattle's grunge scene such as Soundgarden, credited as making a \"place for heavy metal in alternative rock\", and Alice in Chains were at the center of the alternative metal movement.
975	The label was applied to a wide spectrum of other acts that fused metal with different styles: Faith No More combined their alternative rock sound with punk, funk, metal, and hip hop; Primus joined elements of funk, punk, thrash metal, and experimental music; Tool mixed metal and progressive rock; bands such as Fear Factory, Ministry and Nine Inch Nails began incorporating metal into their industrial sound, and vice versa, respectively; and Marilyn Manson went down a similar route, while also employing shock effects of the sort popularized by Alice Cooper.
976	Alternative metal artists, though they did not represent a cohesive scene, were united by their willingness to experiment with the metal genre and their rejection of glam metal aesthetics (with the stagecraft of Marilyn Manson and White Zombie—also identified with alt-metal—significant, if partial, exceptions).
977	Alternative metal's mix of styles and sounds represented \"the colorful results of metal opening up to face the outside world.
978	\"In the mid- and late 1990s came a new wave of U.S. metal groups inspired by the alternative metal bands and their mix of genres.
979	Dubbed \"nu metal\", bands such as Slipknot, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, P.O.D., Korn and Disturbed incorporated elements ranging from death metal to hip hop, often including DJs and rap-style vocals.
980	The mix demonstrated that \"pancultural metal could pay off\".
981	Nu metal gained mainstream success through heavy MTV rotation and Ozzy Osbourne's 1996 introduction of Ozzfest, which led the media to talk of a resurgence of heavy metal.
982	In 1999, Billboard noted that there were more than 500 specialty metal radio shows in the United States, nearly three times as many as ten years before.
983	While nu metal was widely popular, traditional metal fans did not fully embrace the style.
984	By early 2003, the movement's popularity was on the wane, though several nu metal acts such as Korn or Limp Bizkit retained substantial followings.
985	Recent styles: mid–late 2000s and 2010sMetalcore, a hybrid of extreme metal and hardcore punk, emerged as a commercial force in the mid-2000s decade.
986	Through the 1980s and 1990s, metalcore was mostly an underground phenomenon; pioneering bands include Earth Crisis, other prominent bands include Converge, Hatebreed and Shai Hulud.
987	By 2004, melodic metalcore—influenced as well by melodic death metal—was popular enough that Killswitch Engage's The End of Heartache and Shadows Fall's The War Within debuted at numbers 21 and 20, respectively, on the Billboard album chart.
988	Children of Bodom, performing at the 2007 Masters of Rock festival.
989	Evolving even further from metalcore comes mathcore, a more rhythmically complicated and progressive style brought to light by bands such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, and Protest the Hero.
990	Mathcore's main defining quality is the use of odd time signatures, and has been described to possess rhythmic comparability to free jazz.
991	Heavy metal remained popular in the 2000s, particularly in continental Europe.
992	By the new millennium Scandinavia had emerged as one of the areas producing innovative and successful bands, while Belgium, The Netherlands and especially Germany were the most significant markets.
993	Metal music is more favorably embraced in Scandinavia and Northern Europe than other regions due to social and political openness in these regions.
994	Established continental metal bands that placed multiple albums in the top 20 of the German charts between 2003 and 2008, including Finnish band Children of Bodom, Norwegian act Dimmu Borgir, Germany's Blind Guardian and Sweden's HammerFall.
995	In the 2000s, an extreme metal fusion genre known as deathcore emerged.
996	Deathcore incorporates elements of death metal, hardcore punk and metalcore.
997	Deathcore features characteristics such as death metal riffs, hardcore punk breakdowns, death growling, \"pig squeal\"-sounding vocals, and screaming.
998	Deathcore bands include Whitechapel, Suicide Silence, Despised Icon and Carnifex.
999	The term \"retro-metal\" has been used to describe bands such as Texas-based The Sword, California's High on Fire, Sweden's Witchcraft, and Australia's Wolfmother.
1000	The Sword's Age of Winters (2006) drew heavily on the work of Black Sabbath and Pentagram, Witchcraft added elements of folk rock and psychedelic rock, and Wolfmother's self-titled 2005 debut album had \"Deep Purple-ish organs\" and \"Jimmy Page-worthy chordal riffing\".
1001	Mastodon, which plays in a progressive/sludge style, has inspired claims of a metal revival in the United States, dubbed by some critics the \"New Wave of American Heavy Metal\".
1002	By the early 2010s, metalcore was evolving to more frequently incorporate synthesizers and elements from genres beyond rock and metal.
1003	The album Reckless & Relentless by British band Asking Alexandria (which sold 31,000 copies in its first week), and The Devil Wears Prada's 2011 album Dead Throne (which sold 32,400 in its first week) reached up to number 9 and 10, respectively, on the Billboard 200 chart.
1004	In 2013, British band Bring Me the Horizon released their fourth studio album Sempiternal to critical acclaim.
1005	The album debuted at number 3 on the UK Album Chart and at number 1 in Australia.
1006	The album sold 27,522 copies in the US, and charted at number 11 on the US Billboard Chart, making it their highest charting release in America until their follow-up album That's the Spirit debuted at no. 2 in 2015.
1007	Also in the 2010s, a metal style called \"djent\" developed as a spinoff of standard progressive metal.
1008	Djent music uses rhythmic and technical complexity, heavily distorted, palm-muted guitar chords, syncopated riffs and polyrhythms alongside virtuoso soloing.
1009	Another typical characteristic is the use of extended range seven, eight, and nine-string guitars.
1010	Djent bands include Periphery, Tesseract and Textures.
1011	Sharon Osbourne would become the manager for several bands, but is most remembered for her work with Ozzy Osbourne and Motörhead.
1012	Lzzy Hale of Halestorm.
1013	Women in heavy metalThe history of women in heavy metal can be traced back as far as the 1970s when the band Vixen was formed in 1973.
1014	Another hard rock band that featured all-female members, The Runaways, would be founded in 1975.
1015	And while The Runaways may have been lost to time, two former members would rise to fame in solo careers.
1016	Those being Joan Jett and Lita Ford, who would have successful rock careers.
1017	In 1978, with the rise of the new wave of British heavy metal, the band Girlschool would be founded, who are best known for their collaboration with Motörhead in 1980 under the pseudonym Headgirl.
1018	In 1996, Finnish band Nightwish was founded and has featured women as vocalists.
1019	This would lead to more women fronting heavy metal bands such as Halestorm, Within Temptation, Arch Enemy, and Epica among others.
1020	Women have had an important role behind the scenes, such as Gaby Hoffmann and Sharon Osbourne.
1021	In 1981, Hoffmann would help Don Dokken acquire his first record deal.
1022	Hoffmann also became the manager of Accept in 1981 and wrote songs under the pseudonym of \"Deaffy\" for many of band's studio albums.
1023	In the band's newer albums, vocalist Mark Tornillo stated that Hoffmann still had some influence in songwriting.
1024	Osbourne, the wife and manager of Ozzy Osbourne, would found the Ozzfest music festival and manage several bands, included Motörhead, Coal Chamber, The Smashing Pumpkins, Electric Light Orchestra, Lita Ford and Queen.

1164	Written by Steve Harris, the band's bass player and primary songwriter, it serves as the title track to Iron Maiden's 1992 album Fear of the Dark.
1165	The single \"Fear of the Dark (live)\" is the 26th single released by the band.
1166	This live version of the song (as well as the live versions of \"Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter\", \"Be Quick or Be Dead\", and \"Tailgunner\") are taken from the live album A Real Live One.
1167	The single reached number 8 in the UK charts.
1168	The live version of \"Hooks in You\" was recorded at the Wembley Arena, London, UK on 17 December 1990.
1169	 The initial pressing of the 7\" cut-to-shape vinyl picture disc listed \"Hooks in You\" as the B-side but actually played \"Tailgunner\".
1170	 This mis-press was quickly corrected by EMI on future pressings.
1171	The song has been covered by German a cappella metal band van Canto on their album Hero, as well as the Italian metal band Graveworm on their 2001 album Scourge of Malice, by the also Italian death metal band Infernal Poetry on their 2005 album Beholding the Unpure and by the Finnish band Sturm und Drang as the bonus track on their 2008 album Rock 'n Roll Children.

1175	\"Fear of the Dark\" was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1994 in the \"Best Metal Performance\" category, but lost to \"I Don't Want To Change The World\" by Ozzy Osbourne.
1176	When the song is performed live, the audience always sings along to the instrumental melody during the softer sections, at times becoming louder than the band themselves.
1177	It has been featured on all the band's live albums since its release.
1178	The single's cover art features Eddie playing Steve Harris' signature Fender Precision Bass.
1179	LyricsThe song's lyrics tell the story of a man who has always been intensely afraid of the dark.
1180	He recalls the many times he has walked alone, and recollections of the feeling of being followed while walking at night.

1235	Below is a typed version of that chart, which can be found on the second disc of the film's special edition DVD package.

1267	In the special features to the DVD of the film, Dunn attempted a restitution to the concerns of the black metal fans by including an additional featurette.

1269	DeathgasmDeathgasm-poster.jpgJason Lei HowdenJason Lei HowdenSimon RabyJeff HurrellDark Sky Films (US)86 minutesNew ZealandEnglishDeathgasm is a 2015 New Zealand comedy horror film written and directed by Jason Lei Howden in his directorial debut.
1270	The film premiered on 14 March 2015 at South by Southwest and was released in theaters later that year to positive reviews.
1271	PlotLong after the death of his father, Brodie's mother is institutionalized at a mental hospital.
1272	The teenager is thus obliged to move into his uncle's place in Greypoint.
1273	Brodie is a heavy metal fan, which conflicts with Uncle Albert's fundamentalist Christian beliefs.
1274	His fellow high school students regard him as an outcast, which leads to bullying from other boys (including his cousin, David).
1275	Brodie's only friends are two \"geeks\" named Dion and Giles, both of whom spend most of their time playing role playing games.
1276	Brodie soon becomes acquainted with another heavy metal fan, Zakk, at a local record store.
1277	Shortly after, Zakk, Brodie, Dion, and Giles form a metal band called 'DEATHGASM'.
1278	To Brodie's surprise, the beautiful Medina appears to be interested in him and invites him to have ice cream with her.
1279	However, Brodie is too shy and misses the chance to kiss Medina by the end of the date.
1280	Later, Zakk tells Brodie about the metal musician Rikki Daggers, who is allegedly living nearby.
1281	Zakk convinces Brodie to accompany him to an abandoned house, where he suspects Daggers to be hiding.
1282	After breaking in, they find Daggers sleeping inside, holding a record album.
1283	When Brodie and Zakk try to steal the album, Daggers wakes up and attacks.
1284	When he hears a noise in his house, he hands them the record and tells them to run away.
1285	Moments after Zakk and Brodie have left, a well-dressed man named Vadin enters the house and kills Daggers.
1286	He appears to be part of a cult which is looking for \"The Black Hymn,\" medieval sheet music with the power to summon demons.
1287	Since Vadin failed to obtain the sheets of music, the cult's leader, Aeon, later has him beheaded.
1288	At home, Brodie notices the sheets of music hidden inside of the record's cover.
1289	The band plays the song, as lights flicker in response.
1290	Brodie's Uncle Albert, who is outside, hyperventilates and starts to bleed from his eyes.
1291	Brodie senses that something is wrong, and abruptly stops playing his guitar before they manage to complete the hymn.
1292	The next day in school, Brodie translates the Latin writing on the old sheets of music.
1293	He finds out it reads: \"The black hymn.
1294	Play it to invoke the demon.\"
1295	On the way home, Brodie's cousin David lies in wait for him and beats him up violently to make him stay away from Medina, in whom he is also interested.
1296	In the meanwhile, Medina meets Zakk by chance.
1297	She tells him that she could not find Brodie and asks him to give him a note.
1298	Zakk reads the note and finds out Medina wants to meet Brodie at the local park in the late evening.
1299	He does not pass it on to Brodie, but goes there himself and lies to Medina that Brodie does not want to see her.
1300	Then he puts his jacket around her shoulders and they kiss.
1301	Brodie suspects that playing the Black Hymn is somehow connected to dark forces.
1302	Due to the humiliation by David and his friend, he wants to take possession of these powers to take revenge and therefore calls the band together to play the hymn.
1303	After having played it, the stereo equipment explodes and all band members fall unconscious.
1304	After waking up, all four notice that something has changed.
1305	Brodie meets Terry, a strange and frightening being in the school's toilet, who threatens him.
1306	Soon after the encounter with Terry, Mr. Cappenhurst starts to bleed from his body's orifices and throws up blood on a student during a lesson.
1307	In the evening, Brodie meets Zakk in a repair shop to tell him what happened where they are attacked by Zakk's father.
1308	The latter acts as if possessed, tears out his own eyes and then tries to kill them, but the two manage to defend themselves and kill him.
1309	Meanwhile, Dion and Giles also are attacked and nearly killed by a possessed, but Medina manages to save them by killing the possessed man using an axe.
1310	They decide to hide in the school's panic room and leave a note on Brodie's door to inform him about their whereabouts.
1311	Trying to find out what is happening, Zakk and Brodie meets with Abigail, a fortune teller.
1312	She tells them they have invoked the demon Aeloth \"The Blind One\" by playing the hymn, and that the residents of town are now possessed by Aeloth's minions, which kill every human being in order to prepare Aeloth's arrival.
1313	By 3 AM, Aeloth will merge with the most evil human being present.
1314	Before she is able to tell them how to undo Aeloth's summoning, she is killed by two of the possessed.
1315	Zakk is not interested in fighting Aeloth any further and decides to watch the town's doom from a nearby hill, but Brodie manages to convince him to help because he assumes the summoning will be undone by playing the Black Hymn backwards.
1316	They drive to Brodie's house to obtain the sheets of music.
1317	However, Zakk secretly removes the note stuck to the door by Dion, Giles and Medina and the sheets of music are blown out of the window by the wind.
1318	Suddenly, they are attacked by Brodie's uncle Albert and his wife Mary who have also been possessed, but manage to kill them using three dildos and a chainsaw.
1319	In contrast to his parents, Brodie's cousin David has not transformed yet, but Brodie decapitates David anyway as he enters the room.
1320	Having decided they will search the sheets of paper, Zakk and Brodie craft a few weapons and go after them.
1321	In the meantime, the members of the cult have come to Greypoint to serve Aeloth.
1322	They meet with Terry who appears to be Aeloth's ambassador.
1323	Terry promises Aeon that Aeloth will merge with him.
1324	In this moment, Aeson is killed by his acolyte Shanna, who then claims the lead of the cult.
1325	After having found all the sheets of notes, Zakk and Brodie go to the school building since they know there are amplifiers which allow them to play the hymn backwards.
1326	There, they meet Dion, Giles and Medina.
1327	As Brodie notices Zakk's jacket in Medina's bag, Zakk's lie is revealed.
1328	Brodied is hurt and angered by Zakk's betrayal, and Zakk tells Brodie he is not interested in Medina but simply wanted to have some fun to which Brodie responds with a punch to Zakk's face.
1329	A fight ensues between the two, which Zakk manages to win.
1330	He then decides to leave town.
1331	Reasoning that they can stop the evil by playing the music backwards, and that they must play loud enough for the entire town to hear, Brodie and the others go to Rikki Daggers’ house to use Rikki’s amplifiers.
1332	There, Shanna and the cult confront the teens.
1333	Shanna takes Medina hostage, forcing Brodie to turn over the music pages in an exchange.
1334	Shanna tears up the sheets and takes everyone prisoner.
1335	However, Zakk feels remorse for his friends and returns to them.
1336	He manages to free them and they attack the cult during their ritual for Aeloth.
1337	Brodie starts to play the Black Hymn backwards while the others defend him from the attacks by the cult members.
1338	In this fight, most of the cult members as well as Dion and Giles are killed.
1339	Brodie does not manage to play the hymn entirely before 3 AM, so Aeloth is able to enter Shanna's body.
1340	Zakk then kills her, but since he is the most evil person amongst the remaining, Aeloth then takes possession of his body.
1341	Brodie realizes it's too late to complete the hymn, so instead he just plays heavy metal straight from his heart.
1342	The power of the music causes Zakk to collapse and temporarily transform back into his human body, but the respite is brief as Zakk can feel the demon trying to regain control.
1343	 Zakk then urges Brodie to kill him in order to prevent the demon's resurrection, which Brodie eventually does.
1344	A few months later, Brodie and Medina are a happy Death Metal couple in Greypoint.
1345	Brodie puts on a record and Zakk's spirit plays a prank to make it look like Aeloth is returning.
1346	In a post-credits scene, Brodie and Zakk (who is speaking through the record player) have a conversation about what hell is like.

1348	The film won the 2013 Make My Horror Movie contest and received a NZ$200,000 prize to go toward production, which took place in mid-2014.
1349	 Executive producer Ant Timpson cited Howden's \"sheer enthusiasm and utter commitment\" as to why it won.
1350	ReceptionRotten Tomatoes reports that 88% of 25 critics gave the film a positive notice; the average rating is 6.4/10.
1351	The site's consensus states: \"Deathgasm plumbs the blood-spattered depths of grindhouse gore with enough giddy glee to satisfy genre enthusiasts looking for a thrill.\"
1352	On Metacritic, the film has a 65 out of 100 rating, based on 10 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".
1353	Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote that the script does not live up the vivid splatter effects, but the film's \"consistent if undiscriminating high energy engenders a certain persuasive goodwill\".
1354	Richard Whittaker of The Austin Chronicle wrote, \"Shamelessly low-brow, reaching a beer-fueled gleeful high with a zombie-vs.-sex toys battle, it's a very metal tribute to the grand tradition of Kiwi splatter comedies.\"
1355	Matt Donato of We Got This Covered rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \"Deathgasm is the ultimate midnight movie (for metalheads especially), hitting on notes of horror insanity that blend face-melting riffage with equally outstanding practical effects.
1356	\"At Bloody Disgusting, Brad Miska and Patrick Cooper reviewed the film, and both rated it four out of five stars.
1357	Miska called it \"the most metal horror film ever\", and Cooper said that it was \"the movie the SXSW Midnighters category was created for\".
1358	Drew Tinnin of Dread Central rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \"Deathgasm knows exactly what it is and where its heart is, giving genre fans a welcome return to heavy metal in horror without cutting back on any of the splatstick that New Zealand has become known for, for better or worse.\"
1359	Zach Gayne of Twitch Film wrote, \"[T]he voice that shines through the hysterical dialogue and playfully comic editing, is so teenage, so punk, it makes a beat-to-death genre feel refreshing.\"
1360	Heather Wixson of Daily Dead rated it 5/5 stars and called it a \"ridiculously fun and bombastic celebration of horror and heavy metal\".
1361	In early 2016, Walmart refused to sell Deathgasm in its current form.
1362	Walmart renamed the film to a more 'acceptable' title \"Heavy Metal Apocalypse.\"

1373	The series follows the resulting emotional effects on two families as well as the trials of a group of robots who have attained free will and want their freedom from human ownership.
1374	It premiered on SVT 1 on 22 January 2012.
1375	The series was written by  and directed by Harald Hamrell and .
1376	As of 2013, the series has been sold to about 50 countries, including Australia, France, Germany, and South Korea.
1377	A second season of ten episodes premiered on SVT1 in October 2013.
1378	In April 2013 it was announced that Lars Lundström was writing a third series, but as of August 2014, SVT is yet to officially announce whether the series will be renewed for a third season.
1379	, Lundström said in an interview with Festival Court Métrange, \"We have planned for a third season, we have written a whole outline and some scripts, but right now it's in decision making (sic); if it's going to happen or not, because we have problem to fund the budget money.
1380	In a couple of weeks, maximum a month, we know, but I'm sorry to say, I'm not very optimistic.\".
1381	Setting
1382	The story takes place in a version of present-day Sweden where the use of androids is commonplace.
1383	The androids, known as hubots, function as servants, workers, companions, and even illicitly as sexual partners, with different models having specific features designed for their distinctive roles.
1384	While some people embrace this new technology, others are disturbed by it.
1385	A far-right political movement, the \"real humans\", arises in opposition to the encroachment of hubots upon human society.
1386	Some members use the derogatory term \"Pacmans\" to refer to hubots.
1387	Hubots are usually programmed to recognise and obey their owner and can learn skills and pick up knowledge through observation of humans.
1388	Hubots have begun to replace human workers in many industries, especially in the performance of repetitive tasks.
1389	Though they are designed to closely resemble humans, hubots are usually easy for humans to recognise as they have bright flawless skin, glossy hair and unnaturally bright (usually very blue or very green) eyes.
1390	All Hubots also have a USB-like port, in either the back of the neck or in their lower back, which is used for programming and data.
1391	The button to activate or de-power a hubot is located under the left armpit, as is a standard wall plug cord for recharging purposes.
1392	Hubots require only electricity to survive and must recharge regularly, during which they enter a sleep-like state.
1393	Hubot skin feels similar to human skin and is kept at normal human body temperature, but beneath the skin are metal components and a blue fluid/lubricant known as HubFluid.
1394	Hubots are also programmed to be docile.
1395	They obey a set of rules called \"Asimov\" protocols that prevent them from harming humans.
1396	However, some hubots have been modified beyond the legal protocols to function as lovers or bodyguards.
1397	Such practices are illegal in Sweden and those who modify the programming of the hubots are known as \"home-brewers\".
1398	A small, low-funded branch of the police is set up to investigate hubot related crimes, known as E-HURB.
1399	Hubot-human sexual activity is taboo but not uncommon and many hubots are programmed for limited sexual activity.
1400	Those who pursue sexual relationships with hubots are derisively called \"Hubbies\".
1401	Further, those hubots reprogrammed by original hubot creator David Eischer have started to develop feelings, desires and their own goals, attaining an apparent capacity for free will and independence from humans.
1402	Their code is designed to integrate and balance various emotions simultaneously as opposed to the one-emotion-at-a time code that standard hubots have.
1403	They are still often naive and unworldly and sometimes fail to understand the nuances of complex human behaviour.
